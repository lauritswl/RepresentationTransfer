"Your acceptance of a television and stereo CD player upon payment from David Chang of an amount you understood to be the cost to Mr. Chang, rather than fair market retail value, evidenced poor judgment, displayed a lack of due regard for Senate rules and resulted in a violation of the Senate Gifts Rules (35) and, consequently, a violation of your public disclosure obligations under Senate rules.",2.5,3.3
The Ethics Committee was unconvinced.,2.7,2.7
"Your acceptance on loan from Mr. Chang of bronze statues (eagle and bronco buster) for display in your Senate office under your office's policy of accepting the loan of home state artwork was not consistent with Senate rules governing such loans, evidenced poor judgment, displayed a lack of due regard for the Senate rules and resulted in a violation of the Senate Gifts Rule (35) and, consequently, a violation of your public disclosure obligations under Senate rules.",2.6,2.8

"Your failure to act to prevent the acceptance of or to pay for gifts of earrings from Mr. Chang to individuals (your sister, an employee and a friend) in your home at Christmas on the mistaken belief that such items were of little value or were not gifts to you under the circumstances, evidenced poor judgment, displayed a lack of due regard for Senate rules and resulted in a violation of the Senate Gifts Rule (35) and, consequently, a violation of your public disclosure obligations under Senate Rule 34.",2.67,2.89

"""This matter was far more serious than what the committee found,""",2.57,3.0

"According to two government officials involved in the inquiry, the Ethics Committee received a vast amount of information from federal investigators, some of it under a court order issued in March.",2.9,2.9
"That information included witness statements, store receipts and other documents indicating that Chang had paid for expensive items given to Torricelli, his sister, one of his longtime aides, Roberta Stern, and one of Torricelli's former girlfriends, Judy D. Balaban.",3.0,2.82
"The committee's letter did not mention Chang's reported gifts to Torricelli of an $8,100 Rolex watch, about a dozen Italian-made suits and a $3,816 antique grandfather clock.",2.89,3.0

"""Your actions and failure to act led to violations of Senate rules (and related statutes) and created at least the appearance of impropriety,"" the three Democrats and three Republicans on the committee said in a three-page letter to Torricelli.",2.5,3.1
A government official involved in the inquiry said that evidence of those gifts was either incomplete or the subject of conflicting accounts by different witnesses.,2.8,2.8
The committee confirmed Torricelli's claims he had made partial repayments to Chang for two gifts: a large-screen television and a stereo compact-disc player.,3.2,2.8
"But it said the senator had showed ""poor judgment"" by failing to reimburse him for the full market value of the gifts.",2.8,2.8

The ethics panel also criticized Torricelli for taking two bronze statues on loan from Chang.,2.7,2.8
"The statues, the existence of which had not been publicly known before, were displayed in Torricelli's Senate office.",3.0,3.0
"Finally, the committee appeared to have discounted Torricelli's contention that he was not responsible for expensive earrings that Chang had given as Christmas gifts to his sister, Stern and Balaban.",3.1,3.0

"""that such items were of little value or were not gifts to you under the circumstances""",2.9,3.0
"According to a government official involved in the inquiry, the information reviewed by the Ethics Committee also included an analysis by federal investigators showing that during the period in which Chang claimed to have made numerous cash payments to Torricelli, the senator spent thousands of dollars more in cash than investigators could account for from his bank withdrawals and other known sources of income.",2.62,3.0
"The analysis, which was assembled from banking and credit records, income-tax returns and congressional financial-disclosure forms, showed by March of 1998, Torricelli's cash expenditures were more than $22,000 in excess of the cash he had generated from checks and automatic-teller machines, an official who has reviewed the document said.",3.0,3.0
"A spokeswoman for Torricelli, Debra DeShong, said he had fully accounted for all the money he had spent.",2.9,3.0

"""a witness wholly without credibility.""",2.67,2.89
"Moving quickly to make a campaign issue of the Senate letter, Bill Pascoe, Forrester's campaign manager, said the findings were evidence that Torricelli had undertaken an ""extensive campaign of misinformation and deceit,"" and called on him to release the sworn testimony he gave to the panel.",3.0,3.0

"Moore is a professional filmmaker -- he concentrates on maximum impact of each of the statements he cites, and to accomplish that effect, uses subtle interludes instead of long-winded introductions.",3.0,3.0
"Not surprisingly, much of the criticism of Moore's film is misguided or outright wrong, often vastly more inaccurate than Moore's work itself.",2.8,3.0
"This is a common technique, but because conservative readers are not familiar with the basics of filmmaking, they believe critics who claim that he is ""distorting"" the interview.",2.9,2.9
What he does is standard filmmaking practice.,3.0,3.0
The same goes for the interview which follows.,2.91,2.82
"Moore's critics would expect us to have him quote Heston in his entirety, have him present fully the PR that the NRA has used to justify its rally in Denver for reasons of ""balance"".",2.8,3.1
The NRA was fully aware of the scandal it would cause through its rally and decided to push on because they believed to have enough media support to successfully do so.,3.0,3.0
They were right.,3.4,3.0
"You claim that there was ""no way to change location, since you have to give advance notice of that to the members, and there were upwards of 4,000,000 members.""",2.67,2.89
"10 days are more than enough to give advance warning of a change in location or date, had the NRA really wanted to.",2.78,3.22
That does not change the fact that they did just that.,2.8,2.8
Moore presents the most important part of the speech to back up this point and ignores the fluff.,3.1,2.8
This is what good documentary filmmaking is about.,3.5,3.2
And here the critics again ignore important evidence:,2.2,3.0
"When Heston mentions the mayor of Denver, the crowd boos loudly.",2.5,3.2
Heston maganimously holds up a hand to read the mayor's letter (only to explain in detail why he chose to ignore the request -- not mentioning at all the reasons you have given!),2.5,3.25
"This booing by the crowd, not mentioned with a single word in your transcript or your article, shows that the crowd was fully aware of the controversy they would cause by coming to Littleton after children were being killed there -- and they effectively said ""Fuck you"".",1.7,3.7
"""Fuck you""",1.2,4.2
To say that they could not have done otherwise is a bold lie by Moore's critics.,2.6,3.1
4) The Kayla Rolland case.,3.0,2.88
"The rally took place on October 17, the shooting on February 29.",2.56,3.0
"Again, standard filmmaking techniques are interpreted as smooth distortion:",2.9,2.8
"""Moore works by depriving you of context and guiding your mind to fill the vacuum -- with completely false ideas.",2.7,3.2
"It is brilliantly, if unethically, done.""",2.78,3.0
"As noted above, the ""from my cold dead hands"" part is simply Moore's way to introduce Heston.",3.0,2.89
Did anyone but Moore's critics view it as anything else?,3.0,2.75
"He certainly does not ""attribute it to a speech where it was not uttered"" and, as noted above, doing so twice would make no sense whatsoever if Moore was the mastermind deceiver that his critics claim he is.",3.0,2.89
"Concerning the Georgetown Hoya interview where Heston was asked about Rolland, you write: ""There is no indication that [Heston] recognized Kayla Rolland's case.""",2.9,3.1
This is naive to the extreme -- Heston would not be president of the NRA if he was not kept up to date on the most prominent cases of gun violence.,2.6,3.0
"Even if he did not respond to that part of the interview, he certainly knew about the case at that point.",3.0,3.1
"Regarding the NRA website excerpt about the case and the highlighting of the phrase ""48 hours after Kayla Rolland is pronounced dead"":",2.7,3.1
"This is one valid criticism, but far from the deliberate distortion you make it out to be; rather, it is an example for how the facts can sometimes be easy to miss with Moore's fast pace editing.",3.0,2.8
"His documentary is full of subtle humor, jaw-dropping dialogue and dark contrasts.",3.1,3.2
"The reason the sentence is highlighted is not to deceive the viewer into believing that Heston hurried to Flint to immediately hold a rally there (as will become quite obvious), but simply to highlight the first mention of the name ""Kayla Rolland"" in the text, which is in this paragraph.",3.1,2.9
"Unfortunately, because the zooming is rather fast, it is easy to miss the rest of the sentence, so as you correctly note, some viewers got an incorrect impression.",2.7,2.9
It would have been fair for Moore to point out this possible misinterpretation on his website.,3.0,2.5
"However, the claim of deliberate distortion is ludicrous for several reasons:",2.7,3.2
"a) Moore clearly states that ""before he came to Flint"", Heston gave an interview.",3.14,3.29
"""before he came to Flint""",3.0,2.86
"In the excerpt from said interview, we can see that it is from March.",3.0,2.86
"All in all, it is an accurate portrayal of America's gun and violence culture.",2.89,2.89
"If Moore wanted to deceive his viewers, why would he say this, and show the month the interview was published?",2.88,3.12
"b) Why should Moore leave the words ""Clinton is on the Today Show"" visible in the text, which is necessary to correctly interpret the highlighted part?",3.0,3.25
I reviewed the sequence several times and it is perfectly possible to see this text without pausing.,2.9,3.0
"c) Both the ""soccer mom"" interview and the sequences showing the NRA rally make no effort to distort the fact that this rally happened months after the fact.",2.8,2.9
"The camera lingers on Bush/Cheney posters, and the protestor is quoted as saying that ""we wanted to let the NRA know that we haven't forgotten about Kayla Rolland"".",2.4,2.8
"""we wanted to let the NRA know that we haven't forgotten about Kayla Rolland""",2.9,3.0
"You make the hysterical claim that the interview ""may be faked"" (on the basis that no name is shown for the interviewee), but if Moore had faked it, why the hell should he put this sentence in the protestor's mouth, which directly contradicts the conclusion that the rally happened hours after Kayla's death?",2.36,3.18
"It also raises questions about America's foreign policy of recent decades, questions which have been all but ignored by Moore's critics.",2.8,3.3
"Why did Moore, the masterful deveiver, not edit this sequence out?",2.7,3.2
This makes no sense.,2.37,3.25
"Opinions may vary on how tasteless it was for Heston to hold a pro gun rally on the location of the nation's youngest school shooting months after the fact, but this sequence of ""Bowling"" is without doubt the most unfair to Heston.",2.5,3.4
"The claims of deliberate distortion don't hold up when viewing the whole scene, though -- as ""Hanlon's Razor"" states, one should never attribute to malice what can be attributed to incompetence.",2.7,3.0
"The somewhat inept editing of the NRA press release has led some viewers to wrong conclusions, which is unfortunate, but Moore's critics have no interest in viewing the matter fairly.",2.8,2.8
"In any case, at no point does Moore make a false statement, in contradiction to claims by critics that his documentary is ""full of lies"".",3.0,3.14
"""Having created the desired impression, Moore follows with his Heston interview.""",3.3,3.1
"You accuse Moore so often of changing the chronology, yet you have no problems changing it yourself.",2.78,3.33
The Heston interview is at the very end of the movie.,3.0,3.0
"On your webpage, you state that ""Moore's resolution is questionable.",3.0,2.89
"After the Flint rally comes a brief TV interview with Heston, where he is asked about Kayla Rolland (again, clear evidence that the local media in Flint raised questions about the NRA's presence), then an inteview with country prosecutor Arthur Busch, entirely ignored by critics of the film, who also mentions Heston's presence as notable, and refers to the immediate reactions of ""people from all over America"", gun owners/groups who, according to him, reacted aggressively to warnings of having guns accessible to children, much like spanking advocates react aggressively when anti-spankers point to a case of a child being killed or severely injured by a beating.",2.3,3.4
"""Moore's resolution is questionable.",2.6,2.9
"After all, early in the movie he discards the possibility that playing violent video games and watching violent flicks can cause violence -- because Canadians like, and Japanese positively love, those.",3.0,3.2
"These people do not feel the need to express sympathy, or to think about ways to avoid such incidents, but they feel the need to assert their ""rights"" and to look for quick, simple answers -- as Busch states, gun owners wanted to ""hang [the child] from the highest tree"".",2.18,3.64
"This is all not mentioned by critics of Moore's movie, who claim to be objective.",2.9,2.9
"Perhaps the best example of the paranoia surrounding Moore's film is your sub-essay ""Is the end of the Heston interview itself faked?",2.8,2.9
Moore answers a simple question -- how could the scene have been filmed -- with a simple answer: two cameras.,2.9,3.0
"From this, you construct an obscure conspiracy of ""re-enactment"": ""For all we can tell, Moore could have shouted 'Hey!' to make Heston turn around and then remained silent as Heston left.""",3.0,3.0
"""For all we can tell, Moore could have shouted 'Hey!' to make Heston turn around and then remained silent as Heston left.""",3.11,3.22
'Hey!',3.12,3.63
"Even if your ""re-enactment"" theory is true (and I see no evidence that you have actually tried to ask the people involved in the filmmaking for their opinion), this itself is not unethical, and you have no evidence whatsoever that Moore has done anything unethical here, just like you have no evidence that Moore has unethically removed parts of the interview.",2.8,3.0
"You use standard filmmaking technique as a basis to construct bizarre conspiracies which sound plausible to the gullible reader, without ever providing any evidence for the implicit or explicit claims of fraud and distortion.",2.73,2.91
"6)Animated history of the US. Of course the cartoon is highly oversimplified, and most critics consider it one of the weakest parts of the film.",2.8,2.7
"But it makes a valid claim which you ignore entirely: That the strategy to promote ""gun rights"" for white people and to outlaw gun possession by black people was a way to uphold racism without letting an openly terrorist organization like the KKK flourish.",2.5,2.9
Did the 19th century NRA in the southern states promote gun rights for black people?,2.83,2.83
I highly doubt it.,2.73,3.0
"But if they didn't, one of their functions was to continue the racism of the KKK.",2.6,3.1
"This is the key message of this part of the animation, which is again being ignored by its critics.",2.37,2.87
"If violent movies and violent videogames cannot cause violence -- then how can newscasts about violence do so?""",2.37,3.63
7) Buell shooting in Flint.,2.6,3.1
"You write: ""Fact: The little boy was the class thug, already suspended from school for stabbing another kid with a pencil, and had fought with Kayla the day before"".",2.5,3.0
"""Fact: The little boy was the class thug, already suspended from school for stabbing another kid with a pencil, and had fought with Kayla the day before""",2.57,3.29
This characterization of a six-year-old as a pencil-stabbing thug is exactly the kind of hysteria that Moore's film warns against.,2.2,3.5
It is the typical right-wing reaction which looks for simple answers that do not contradict the Republican mindset.,3.0,3.3
"The kid was a little bastard, and the parents were involved in drugs -- case closed.",2.3,3.3
But why do people deal with drugs?,2.88,3.13
Because it's so much fun to do so?,3.5,3.2
"It is equally well known that the so-called ""war on drugs"" begun under the Nixon administration is a failure which has cost hundreds of billions and made America the world leader in prison population (both in relative and absolute numbers).",2.5,3.3
"In poor areas, the highly profitable drug business obviously is often seen as the last resort.",2.5,3.0
"But the real cause here are not the drugs themselves, but poverty and the ""war on drugs"".",2.6,2.9
This is a faulty generalization.,2.44,2.89
"Had the boy's mother not been shipped to a ""welfare to work"" program, she might at least have had some time to spend with her son.",2.2,3.2
"Virtually every child psychologist knows that mother/child bonding is essential for the development of empathy and social abilities, the awareness of the consequences of one's actions, and the learning of conflict resolution by non-violent means.",3.11,3.33
"If, as Moore implies (although never states as fact), video games and violent movies are relatively harmless, it does not logically follow that all types of media presentation are harmless.",2.8,3.0
"Even the official quoted by Moore blames the welfare to work program, knowing full well that the drug issue is a red herring.",2.7,3.1
"Once again, your emphasis on the little boy as a thug confirms Moore's (and Busch's) assertion that people wanted to hang the child from the highest tree instead of looking at the real causes.",2.4,3.3
"That's because while there is a so-called war on drugs, there is no war on poverty.",2.5,3.1
"Poverty is frequently portrayed as natural, and the poor in America are seen by conservatives as VCR-owners who are just too lazy to work.",2.5,3.25
"In reality, what Moore describes here is the most vivid example of what can only be called wage slavery I have ever seen, to the detriment of families.",2.6,2.9
"It is notable that the Wall Street Journal's reaction to this segment of the film was even more dismissive than yours: It called Moore's claim ""preposterous"".",3.0,2.9
", probably the most comprehensive among many rebuttals of the Oscar-winning documentary.",3.1,3.0
How could he even think about blaming poverty and forced labor programs for anything bad that happens?,2.37,3.12
8) Taliban and American aid.,3.0,2.8
"After the September 11 attacks, it was necessary for conservatives to somehow explain away the fact that the US government gave 245 million dollars to the new evildoers du jour.",2.57,3.29
Never mind the fact that authors such as Robert Scheer warned of aiding the Taliban as early as in May 2001.,2.86,3.0
"Never mind that they did so not out of some humanitarian motivation, but because of the Taliban's violent enforcement of the ban on opium poppies.",2.7,3.1
"Never mind that in a regime that is controlled by warlords, it does not matter who is authorized to distribute the aid -- the ruling regional warlords will seize control of it and use it to their own advantage.",3.0,3.0
Never mind that this very argument has been used by hawks in opposition to sending humanitarian aid to Iraq's Saddam Hussein.,2.9,3.1
Never mind that the Taliban continued selling opium in spite of the deal.,2.86,3.14
"There is a huge difference, for example, between playing a game like ""Quake"" and listening to a radio broadcast that tells you that your family will be killed unless you take action to kill others now.",2.3,3.4
Never mind that this is all documented on Michael Moore's website about the film.,3.0,2.8
9) Gun homicides.,2.2,3.3
"Statistics are Moore's weakest point, and it is surprising that his critics don't dwell on them longer.",2.9,2.8
That's because they know all too well that Moore is correct: The United States have a far greater homicide rate (both gun- and non-gun) than most other first world countries.,2.5,3.1
"His main mistake is that he does not use population corrected data, his second mistake is that he does not cite his sources (and, as you correctly point out, he probably uses different reporting methods for the different countries).",2.6,3.0
A good comparison of international homicide rates can be found on the relatively neutral guncite.com website.,2.8,3.1
"Not surprisingly, guncite, too, compares data from different years -- as I know from personal experience, it is quite difficult to do comparisons of crime statistics due to differences in reporting frequency and methodology.",2.71,3.0
"The gun homicide rates for the countries Moore mentioned, according to guncite, are: Japan: 0.02 per 100,000 (1994)England/Wales: 0.11 per 100,000 (1997)Germany: 0.22 per 100,000 (1994)Australia: 0.44 per 100,000 (1994)United States: 3.72 per 100,000 (1999)",2.9,2.8
"Critics fail to credit Moore with not making the same mistake that some gun control advocates make -- concluding that gun ownership ""leads"" to violence.",2.63,2.88
"In fact, Moore mentions several counter-examples, and more such counter-examples can indeed be cited.",3.0,3.0
It is intuitively obvious that guns do not actually cause violence -- but it is equally intuitively obvious that they make the violence that is committed more deadly.,2.5,2.8
"It is the second intuition which gun rights groups like the NRA seek to obscure using fraudulent data by the likes of John ""Mary"" Lott.",2.9,2.9
"The gun control movement, on the other hand, distracts from the real causes of violence -- poverty, paranoia, the ""war on drugs"" and antisexuality.",3.0,3.29
"If these causes were addressed, gun ownership in the United States would not be a problem (but also unnecessary); just like it is in Switzerland.",2.9,3.0
10) Canada ammunition purchase.,3.0,3.0
You write: Bowling shows Moore casually buying ammunition at an Ontario Walmart.,3.0,3.1
"He asks us to ""look at what I, a foreign citizen, was able to do at a local Canadian Wal-Mart.""",3.12,3.12
"""look at what I, a foreign citizen, was able to do at a local Canadian Wal-Mart.""",3.22,3.0
He buys several boxes of ammunition without a question being raised.,3.0,3.2
"""That's right. I could buy as much ammunition as I wanted, in Canada.",3.3,3.2
Canadian officials have pointed out that the buy is faked or illegal.,2.6,2.9
"Once again, you fail to distinguish between regular film editing and ""faking"" (a word which ""Canadian officials"" have never used; for such a distortion, Moore would have been boiled alive by his critics).",2.5,3.2
"If Moore simply chose not to show how he revealed his identification to the salesperson, there is nothing fraudulent about that.",3.0,3.3
His claim that it is possible to purchase ammunition in supermarkets is independent from that claim.,2.78,2.67
11) Heston's allegedly implied racism.,2.71,3.0
"If anything, it is his own failure that he did not clarify what he meant with ""having a more mixed ethnicity"".",3.0,2.9
"Similarly, the main motivation for the crusades (beyond the promise of wealth) was that Christians were supposedly being slaughtered and had to be saved.",2.36,3.27
Heston's answers in the interview were evasive and unhelpful.,2.2,3.0
"While this can in part be explained with his age and mental condition, if he is unable to defend the interests of the NRA, he should not be their spokesman.",2.9,2.8
"In this case, Hanlon's Razor can be applied to Heston -- he is probably not racist, but incompetent.",2.9,2.8
"If Heston makes himself look like a fool, that should hardly be blamed on Michael Moore.",2.67,3.33
Conclusion,3.0,2.9
"You write: ""Bowling for Columbine is dishonest.",2.7,3.1
"""Bowling for Columbine is dishonest.",2.1,2.9
It is fraudulent.,2.3,3.4
"To trash Heston, it even uses the audio/video editor to assemble a Heston speech that Heston did not give, and sequences images and carefully highlighted text to spin the viewer's mind to a wrong conclusion.""",2.6,2.9
None of this is true.,2.44,3.0
"What is true is that Bowling for Columbine is a diamond in the small world of big screen documentaries, one that shines brightly and illuminates an often misunderstood aspect of American culture.",3.2,3.0
"It is not a flawless diamond -- the ""48 hours"" scene in particular suffers from bad editing, the statistics are suboptimal, and Heston gets a bit more bashing than he deserves.",2.6,3.0
"Other than towards the NRA, the movie tries hard to avoid simplistic conclusions, and comes up with some thoughtful answers.",3.1,2.9
"Obviously, media propaganda can incite people to kill.",1.9,3.2
The most shameful part of the ongoing attacks against Moore is that these answers have been all but ignored by his critics.,2.5,3.3
"Had Moore wanted to make a propaganda film, he would have used other material: photos from America's Emergency Rooms.",3.0,3.2
"Certainly, Moore is one of the most talented filmmakers in the United States today, and his film fully deserved its Oscar.",3.5,3.2
"The shrill (and remarkably unsuccessful) Internet campaign to ""revoke"" his award seems to be motivated more by jealousy than by real concerns about the film's accuracy.",2.5,3.2
"Interactive fiction like video games, on the other hand, presents violence in a narrative context, which may very well desensitize participants to said violence, but no causative link has ever been proven.",2.9,3.0
"It is not only the highest grossing non-music documentary of all time, among the users of the largest Internet film database, IMDB, it is also the highest rated one.",3.6,3.5
"According to the LA Times, the documentary genre ""owes a huge debt to Michael Moore"" -- after Bowling's success, films like ""Spellbound"" and ""Capturing the Friedmans"" were taken seriously and shown in many more theatres than otherwise likely.",3.25,3.0
But perhaps the campaign against Moore is really motivated by another reason.,3.0,3.27
"His next project has the working title ""Fahrenheit 9/11: The temperature at which freedom burns"", and he intends to launch it shortly before the next US presidential election.",3.11,3.11
"It is unlikely, however, that the unfair attacks against him will have much of an impact.",2.25,2.87
"After all, the same kind of PR blitz was started against the previous record-holding documentary: ""Roger & Me"" by Michael Moore.",2.89,2.67
This text is in the public domain.,3.0,2.6
"Moore's hypothesis (which apparently comes at least in part from the book ""Culture of Fear"" by Barry Glassner, also advertised on Moore's website) is that the constant bombardment with messages of fear can incite paranoia, which itself can lead to violent acts.",2.8,3.0
Critics have now gone so far as to call for the revocation of the award.,2.67,3.0
"This is consistent with the kind of media-incited violence described above, and in no relationship whatsoever to the theory of video game or music incited violence.",2.78,3.22
"It is no surprise, however, that US (and European) media do not question their own propaganda of fear.",2.75,3.25
"Moore's second hypothesis is that America's foreign policy may contribute to the belief that violence is an appropriate means to solve conflicts, a hypothesis which is shared by many sociologists and psychologists.",3.0,3.0
"Children who grow up in war-torn regions are known for having similar views -- war is perceived as a normal part of existence, violence as a natural way to solve disputes.",2.62,3.0
"Their chances are small, however, as their arguments rely on polemic, exaggeration and misrepresentation -- in other words, on the same techniques which they accuse Moore of using.",2.75,3.0
"In a weaker sense, the same message is projected to American children, who grow up being told that it is not acceptable to be violent to one another, but who simultaneously have to endure corporal punishment and media messages about how ""the enemies of freedom"" are punished.",2.6,3.1
Moore's film was made before the dead bodies of Qusay and Uday Hussein were paraded on national TV.,2.6,2.6
Americans were gloating over this demented corpse show:,2.4,3.3
"""They squealed like little piggies too, so you'll have to make do with 'oink, oink, squeeeeeeeallll' for their last words.",2.9,3.1
"'oink, oink, squeeeeeeeallll'",3.5,3.63
"That goes for your grandson Mustafa too, by the way.",3.0,2.75
"Still think fucking with the U.S. was a good idea, Sammy?""",2.5,4.13
Mustafa was 14 years when he was killed.,2.1,3.1
"Americans cheer the killing of children, yet wonder why their own children grow up to be more violent than those in other nations.",2.29,3.0
It is paradoxical notions like this one which Moore's film seeks to address.,2.91,3.0
Inaccuracies,3.0,2.67
Your webpage list a number of alleged inaccuracies in Moore's movies.,2.6,3.2
"It is true that Moore's film is sometimes unintentionally deceptive, but to call it fraudulent is hyperbole to the extreme.",2.9,3.0
It is no more so than any other successful documentary of the last decades.,3.0,2.6
Let's look at some specific criticisms:,3.0,2.9
"1) The bank scene, listed on your website on a separate page.",3.0,2.89
"Critics have stated that this scene was ""staged"", but in the bank interview, the official tells Moore that the bank has its own vault storing about 500 weapons at any given time.",3.0,3.0
It is also a licensed firearms dealer which can perform its own background checks.,3.0,3.0
"In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, linked from your site, an employee claims that the gun would have been ""normally"" picked up at another dealer.",3.0,3.1
"Dear David Hardy,",3.0,2.8
"It is not explained what ""normally"" is supposed to mean, but that claim flatly contradicts the statement of the bank official in the film.",2.8,3.0
"This sounds more like a later correction for public relations purposes, but of course nobody questions the bank claims when they can be used against Moore.",2.75,2.75
It is fascinating to watch the organized character assassination of Michael Moore that has been going on in the United States since the release of his last documentary.,3.25,3.38
The only thing that Moore compressed is the timeframe.,3.0,2.75
"According to the same WSJ interview, ""Typically, you're looking at a week to 10 days waiting period.""",2.71,2.71
"""Typically, you're looking at a week to 10 days waiting period.""",2.7,3.0
"This is plausible -- but entirely irrelevant for the movie, which already makes it quite clear that a background check is being performed.",2.9,2.9
"Moore's detractors have sometimes extended those 7-10 days to several weeks, contradicting the bank's own estimate.",3.0,3.0
There is nothing inaccurate whatsoever about the bank scene.,3.0,3.0
The bank does exactly what it advertises: It hands out guns from its vault to those who open an account.,2.7,3.3
"The silly criticisms of the scene obscure the real obscenity of the situation: a bank handing out guns to its customers, higlighting the utter laxness of how Americans deal with deadly weapons and a love of firearms that borders on the religious.",2.43,3.29
2) The Lockheed-Martin interview.,3.0,2.8
"This is perhaps the criticism repeated the most often, and it also the most inaccurate.",2.86,3.0
"First, the actual quotes from the film are often reproduced incorrectly.",2.56,2.89
The dialogue goes as follows:,3.0,2.38
"A defense of Michael Moore and ""Bowling for Columbine""",2.8,2.8
"""So you don't think our kids say to themselves, gee, dad goes off to the factory every day - he builds missiles.",2.9,3.2
These are weapons of mass destruction.,2.37,3.37
"What's the difference between that mass destruction and the mass destruction over at Columbine High School?""",2.7,3.2
"""I guess I don't see that specific connection because the missiles that you're talking about were built and designed to defend us from somebody else who would be aggressors against us.""",2.6,3.4
"In a time of simple-minded patriotism, loud, clear and dissenting voices like Mr. Moore's are perceived as disturbing and have to be silenced, partially through well funded public relations campaigns, partially through conservative ""grass-roots"" propaganda.",2.22,3.33
"Moore is not from Colorado -- his question is generic, not meant to refer specifically to the Lockheed Martin plant in question.",2.88,2.75
McCollum understands it this way -- otherwise he would protest against the plant being mischaracterized.,2.75,3.12
"However, critics of Moore have cleverly ignored McCollum's response and presented Moore as spreading lies about the Lockheed plant.",2.7,3.0
Even Lockheed did not believe the public to be that gullible.,3.0,3.0
"In response to one Moore detractor, McCollum wrote: ""Although other units of Lockheed Martin Corporation elsewhere in the country produce weapons to support the defense of the U.S., we make no weapons at the Littleton-area facility Moore visited.""",3.1,2.8
"""Although other units of Lockheed Martin Corporation elsewhere in the country produce weapons to support the defense of the U.S., we make no weapons at the Littleton-area facility Moore visited.""",3.0,2.8
"Of course, critics have conveniently ignored the fact that Lockheed Martin does supply weapons of mass destruction to the US military, and that the company is the nation's largest military contractor.",2.9,3.2
"As Moore correctly points out, it is bizarre for a society to openly embrace the production of destructive weapons, but on the other hand see no connection of this to everyday violence -- children learn by imitating adults.",2.8,3.2
"Yes, Moore makes this point through slight exaggeration by moving with the camera through the LM plant -- but he makes no incorrect statement.",3.0,3.0
"It is typical for his critics to jump on what is at most a slightly misleading implication, but in doing so, they themselves have, unlike Moore, made many incorrect claims.",2.8,3.0
3) Denver NRA meeting.,3.0,3.0
Critics like yourself claim that Moore has massively distorted evidence to support his point that Charlton Heston has effectively insulted the victims of the Columbine tragedy by holding a rally in Denver shortly afterwards.,2.62,3.13
"First, the ""from my cold, dead hands"" part: This is used by Moore as a visual citation to introduce Heston.",2.82,3.0
"It is perhaps one of his most famous quotes, shown on national TV even here in Germany.",3.14,2.86
"It tells viewers: Aha, this is the person we are talking about.",3.3,3.1
"It is Moore's way to say: Viewers, meet Charlton Heston, gun nut extraordinaire.",3.0,3.12
"The ""visual of a billboard and a narration"" is viewed by you as evidence that Moore is trying to somehow tie the two events together, when in reality, it is quite obvious that he does it to separate the introduction of Heston from his speech in Denver.",2.83,2.83
"If you do have something better to do, though, by all means do it .",2.8,3.1

The one that really stuck in my mind was explaining transitions in the panels of Watchmen .,3.1,3.1
"I'd read Watchmen a short while before and appreciated its narrative complexity, but not being used to reading comics, hadn't registered all the technical tricks that the artist was using to achieve this.",3.1,3.1
"The post not only taught me something about the grammar of such images, but more importantly led to me realising that there is a grammar to look for in the first place.",3.2,3.1
So thanks a lot for that one.,3.2,3.4
"SEK, I started going through your back posts and noticed a pattern in my selections, so I think it would be easier (for me, because I'm rubbish with html) to just say all the scene analysis posts and the close reading comics posts, like the one Magistra mentioned and many others after that.",3.1,2.8

The posts I consider foundational to my current professional identity all seem to have been composed in 2009.,3.0,3.0

"It may also be that I remember the scene of their writing, which would have been in the old apartment, i.e. the place I barely remember ever having lived in anymore.",3.0,3.0
"Because I've been grading all damn day and am as tired as a Swearengen of hearing other about the finished semesters of pretty much every other academic blogger, I thought that it might be best to avoid jealously lashing out and scribble a ""Best of Acephalous 2009"" post.",2.5,3.5
"If you have absolutely nothing better to do on a Friday night, feel free to scan through my 2009 archives and tell me what you think should be included in the ""Best of"" post.",3.0,3.1
"I noted on Facebook that, from a statistical perspective, what makes baseball such an amazing sport is that you can watch it your entire life and still see, on a daily basis, something you’ve never seen before.",3.6,3.6
The fact that I can verify vague memories of events that occurred twenty-five years ago astounds me in a way I sometimes forget the Internet is capable of doing.,3.1,3.2
"This realization is obviously not of world-historical importance, merely a reminder that this thing whose existence we take for granted daily represents a fundamentally weird complement to human memory.",3.0,3.0
The fact that at some point in the future I can know who I rode in an elevator with on 28 December 2005 is less weird because I chose to write about riding in an elevator with Grimace .,2.9,3.0
That I can access detailed information about events I have no right remembering in detail is another matter entirely.,3.1,3.2

Wow.,4.3,4.3
I'd completely forgotten about him.,2.9,3.0
I sometimes wish I could forget that Pendelton is the Braves hitting coach.,2.1,2.8

"In this case, the something in question was watching the wonderfully named Angel Pagan hit an inside-the-park home run and initiate a triple play in the same game.",3.4,3.3
"It is true that at the end of time, the old time baseball writers will be hailed as the very best writers, as they had access to an event that was susceptible to beautiful writing, but horrendous to watch in person.",3.1,3.3
"Plus, they smoked a prodigious quantity of cigarettes.",2.9,3.2
nota bene: An overdue library book is a crime against Humanities.,2.5,3.4
"John Emerson responded with some humbug about it not being an inside-the-park grand slam, which made me remember that I had seen an inside-the-park grand slam at some time in the remote past.",2.9,2.9
"I remember being six or seven years old and watching the Mets play the Cardinals in an afternoon game at Shea Stadium, and thanks to the miracle of the Internet, I can definitively say that at approximately 4:30 p.m. on 9 June 1985 , I watched Terry Pendleton hit an inside-the-park grand slam off Joe Sambito in a game the Cardinals would go on to win handily.",3.5,3.5
"Diagram of the polarization-opponent unit described by Lambrinos, et al (2000).",3.0,2.7
"The unit takes in polarization levels through the two polarization-sensitive photodiodes and feeds them into the logarithm ratio amplifier, which returns the difference of the logarithmized signals from the photodiodes.",2.86,2.71
"The e-vector (heading) returned from the two polarization-sensitive photodiodes (1, 2) follows a cos2-function.",3.0,3.0
"Ants themselves rely primarily on chemical information taken in through their antennae, and to mimic this, Antie will have chemical sensing and emitting “stalks” with which to both interact with other ants (who may be surprised to find an ant without antennae) and take in chemical information.",3.0,3.1
"These stalks will need to have receptors to measure the n-alkene levels present in another ant’s cuticular hydrocarbons, which research indicates is the marker for harvester ants of a nestmate’s current task, perhaps because the hydrocarbons are altered in the dry sun, causing a different ratio of n-alkanes to n-alkenes and the presence of branched n-alkanes in the hydrocarbon profile (Wagner, et al, 2001, as cited in Gordon & Greene, 2003).",3.0,3.0
"Antie’s stalks would also have receptors for the hydrocarbons themselves, which research shows indicate to the ants whether another ant is their nestmate (Arnold, et al, 1996, as cited in Gordon & Mehdiabadi, 1999), receptors to detect food, and receptors for three types of pheromones: those released by successful foragers returning with food, those released by successful patrollers returning to the nest, and those marking piles of trash as midden.",3.0,2.75
Such a robot would allow for both long-term studies of ant-robot interactions and studies of task-switching in the robots.,3.25,3.12
"Returning successful patrollers have an even greater effect on foraging activity: foragers will not leave the nest unless a patroller returns (Gordon, 2002), and the rate of foraging in a colony can be controlled by rolling glass beads coated with cuticular hydrocarbons extracted from patrollers into the nest (Gordon & Greene, 2003; Greene & Gordon, 2007).",3.14,2.86
"Midden seems to be marked in some olfactory way, since removing midden from nests makes them more likely to be invaded by other species (Gordon, 35).",2.82,2.91
"For the purposes of this proposal, I will assume that the nest maintenance and food processing ants have marked the midden with a particular pheromone.",3.0,2.9
"All of these chemical receptors will be arranged in an array on a pair of chemical stalks, with four of each type of receptor per stalk.",3.0,2.75
"I propose here the theoretical construction and programming of a robot (hereafter referred to as Antie) that will be able to infiltrate a red harvester ant nest, switching between the foraging, patrolling and midden work behaviors.",3.0,3.2
"This technique, described by Ishida, et al (2001), has been shown to improve the chemical plume-tracking abilities of robots.",3.0,2.89
The wires will lead back down through the stalk to the on-board PC.,3.0,2.78
"Finally, Antie will have tactile sensors on its grippers to analyze the pressure being exerted on a gripped object.",3.5,3.1
"These sensors will be of the type patented by Peterson, et al (Patent #4,492,949), and will feature several layers of electrically insulating and parallel flexible conductive rods arranged such that an exerted pressure may be measured in output voltage.",3.1,2.9
"These will correspond to the muscles of the ant’s mandibles, which provide sensorimotor feedback to the ant when grasping objects.",3.0,2.89
A table of the sensors and their relation to the ant’s sensory system is provided below.,3.1,3.1
Table of sensors and their relations to the ant.,3.0,2.7
"The red harvester ant lives in hot, dry deserts, building its nests in light yellowy sand and foraging for seeds deposited by winds and rain.",3.0,2.75
"The ants forage for more than 30 different varieties of seeds, many of which do not grow in the desert (Gordon, 54), where only a few varieties of small shrubs, small herbaceous flowering plants and short grasses do grow (Gordon, 51).",3.1,2.8
Introduction,3.0,2.9
Motors,3.0,2.44
Antie’s motors will allow it to move around and interact with its environment and fellow ants.,3.1,2.9
There will be two individually operated motors to drive the two side wheels in lieu of legs.,3.0,3.0
"Two simultaneously operated motors will open and close the grippers, emulating the grasping power of the ant’s mandibles.",3.0,3.1
"A third motor will lift and lower the grippers, allowing Antie to raise and lower gripped items as an ant would by raising and lowering its head.",3.2,3.2
Three small sprayers will emit successful patroller and forager pheromones and cuticular hydrocarbons from the appropriate sacs.,3.0,3.0
"These will be located in different places: the sprayer for the successful patroller pheromone will be located on the rear at the base of Antie, corresponding to the glands that researchers believe the ants drag along behind them to mark returning paths, while the successful forager and cuticular hydrocarbon sprayers will be located on the skirt.",3.0,2.75
"Antie will not spray different pheromones depending on its task, on the assumption that its time in the sun will alter its hydrocarbons enough that its tasks will be recognizable to other ants.",3.11,2.67
"Other insects and creatures, including other species of ants, are present in the desert, but red harvester ants seem to be relatively undisturbed by these animals (Gordon, 7-11).",3.0,2.67
Almost all motor output will be a direct function of sensory input as indicated in the following section.,3.0,2.7
The Behavior,3.0,2.78
"Antie will have a hybrid software architecture: a subsumption hierarchy will be responsible for switching between behaviors, but many sub-behaviors will operate on a schema basis.",3.0,3.2
"Pseudocode will approximate this architecture as closely as possible, and where appropriate, different subroutines running on a schema basis will be marked.",3.1,2.9
Common Behaviors,3.0,3.1
A few sub-behaviors will be necessary for more than one behavior.,3.0,2.88
"To ease Antie’s on-board memory requirements and processing capabilities (and to make all the rest of the pseudocode easier for the reader to understand), I propose a few global variables and subroutines.",3.11,2.89
"The following global variables will be used throughout the pseudocode, and are compiled here for ease of reference:",3.0,2.89
"Though fights sometimes do break out with other red harvester ants from different nests, intraspecies interactions tend not to be aggressive (Gordon, 11).",3.0,3.12
Background,3.0,2.6
"Because of this, I will ignore other ant species in the design of Antie, and will not create a fighting behavior.",3.0,2.8
"Common behaviors will include a forward cruise and turning mechanism, procedures to determine the orientation towards nest and the distance from the nest when outside, in-nest navigation, an escape function for when objects are detected or bumped into, object identification and gripping, a generic algorithm for pheromone plume and chemical trail following, and the identification of other ants.",3.0,2.9
Science fiction writers have been anticipating humanoid androids that could pass a Turing Test for years.,3.1,3.0
"For a simple start, the forward cruise function will merely take in a double integer representing a speed and cause Antie to move forward at this speed.",3.0,3.0
Antie will be equipped to navigate in this environment and will be designed to find seeds in sandy soil.,3.0,3.0
The Ant & the Robot,3.0,2.8
Ants of this species are of two types: breeding ants (queens and drones) and sterile female workers.,2.9,3.1
"These behaviors will often be used in other subroutines running on a schema basis, and when combined with the forward cruise function, should cause the robot to move at an angle.",3.0,3.0
"In order to orient itself toward the nest while navigating outside, Antie will need to determine which direction the nest is in and rotate toward that heading, and also how far from the nest it is at its current location.",3.0,2.67
"The orientation and distance should be calculable by the polarization pattern according to the system set up by Lambrinos, et al.",3.0,2.75
"Antie will therefore have a polarization function that will return a compass direction toward which it should orient in order to return home to the nest, and a distance function that will return the shortest direct distance.",3.0,2.89
"We may assume that this first function will return a direction in degrees, positive or negative, and that the second function will return a distance in centimeters.",3.1,2.7
"Queens and drones will not be considered in this proposal, as their behaviors and design is much more specialized and would be applicable only during the breeding season, which occurs but once per year.",3.0,3.0
The first function might look something like this:,3.0,3.0
"In-nest navigation will be a function of the temperature, read by Antie’s thermometer and a light source.",3.2,2.9
"To exit, Antie will seek a high temperature until the photoreceptor reaches a threshold of stimulation indicating sunlight, and to get deeper, Antie will seek a lower temperature.",3.0,2.75
The code may look something like this:,3.0,3.0
"The behaviors of the sterile workers may be divided into several subcategories: brood care, nest maintenance, patrolling and foraging.",3.0,2.75
"This void function will be called nestEnter(), and will take in no inputs.",3.0,2.6
"To avoid bumping into things (including other ants), Antie be provided with an escape function.",3.0,2.64
"Each of Antie’s eight bump sensors will cause the robot to rotate a different amount, and the sonar will cause it to rotate 90 degrees in the opposite direction.",3.0,2.8
"Regardless, this will be a very simple function.",3.0,3.0
I will include one example:,3.0,3.0
"Little is known about brood care, as this occurs only in the deepest regions of the nest and observation would generally require the destruction of the nest.",2.88,2.75
"Because this function responds to the sensors on Antie’s around the sides and only its sonar detectors will be able to detect objects in front of it, this escape function will not prevent Antie from being able to locate and pick up objects such as seeds.",3.09,2.91
"Before picking objects up, however, Antie will need to identify them.",3.0,3.0
This object detection process will be activated when the front bump sensor is stimulated or when both sonar detectors are stimulated.,3.1,3.0
Chemical inputs will be checked to see what this object is most likely to be given its smell.,3.0,3.1
The code may look something like this:,3.0,2.4
"Nest maintenance and seed processing are likewise difficult to observe in the deeper regions of the nest, but the sorting and deposition of waste dirt and nest garbage outside of the nest (midden work) occurs close enough to the surface to be observable.",3.11,3.11
"Once the object has been identified, Antie may grip it and lift it.",3.0,2.5
"A simple void function grip() taking in no inputs will tighten the grippers until a certain threshold of pressure is reached, at which point the grippers will be lifted for carrying.",3.0,3.14
A void function release() will perform this same action in reverse.,3.0,2.6
"Antie will also need to follow several different kinds of chemical gradient trails: it will need to track the trails left by successful patrollers, and localize the source of food-odors and midden-odors.",3.1,3.0
"Implementations of chemical gradient following robots using two sensors on “antennae” stalks has been successful in with analog robots in the past (Webb, 1998), regardless of the potential problem of airflow causing a disturbed gradient over evaporating pheromones.",3.0,2.8
"As a partial control for the problem of imprecise sensing, a function will perform an analysis of the array information coming on from Antie’s four sensors on each stalk.",3.0,3.0
The differences between these outputs is what is being compared everywhere there is a “left_IP” or “right_IP.”,3.0,2.88
"Antie will use the chemical gradient algorithm of Braitenberg’s aggressive type 2 vehicle described in his book “Vehicles: Experiments in Synthetic Psychology,” as this was found through a series of experiments by Russell, et al (2003) to be very efficient when compared to several biomimetic models.",3.0,3.0
"Because the same general algorithm will be followed for the localization of all three chemical traces, I will provide pseudocode for only one generic subroutine.",3.0,2.8
Note that a portion of this subroutine does run on a schema basis:,3.0,3.1
"Patrolling and foraging, too, occur for the most part outside of the nest, and have therefore been studied extensively (ex., Schafer, et al, 2006; Gordon, et al, 2002; Gordon, 2002; Gordon, 1987).",3.0,2.88
"Unfortunately, as of yet, no robot has managed to fool a human for more than a few seconds, and no robot has been created that can integrate itself into human society.",2.6,2.9
"For the purposes of calls later in the pseudocode, I will refer to these subroutines as trailFollow(), findFood(), and findMidden().",2.9,2.5
All three are void and take no inputs.,2.7,2.7
The final common subroutine will be one for the identification of other ants.,3.1,2.9
"When both sonar sensors are stimulated simultaneously, Antie will check hydrocarbon inputs and determine whether the detected object is a nestmate.",3.0,3.0
"As harvester ants tend not to engage aggressively with non-nestmates, Antie will only identify other ants as ants if they belong to its nest.",3.0,2.86
Proposal for a Red Harvester Ant Robot: Colony Infiltration and Task Switching,3.0,2.91
Antie will attempt to determine the tasks of other ants by sensing only the n-alkene levels.,3.0,3.1
The code will be similar to the object identification subroutine and may look something like this:,3.0,2.6
"Using these basic common behaviors, more complex behaviors may be coded.",3.0,2.9
"Red harvester ants do not retain one task throughout their lifespan, but instead change their behaviors as is appropriate for the colony (Gordon, 1996).",3.1,2.8
"Research has shown that red harvester ants switch tasks partially as a function of age (ex., Ingram, et al, 2005) and partially as a function of interactions with other workers (ex., Schafer et al, 2006; Gordon, 2002; Greene & Gordon, 2007).",3.1,2.8
"Younger ants work more inside the nest, and older ants work more outside the nest.",3.09,2.55
"As a result, I will model the three main behaviors in the order that they are to be engaged in.",3.3,3.2
"Midden work, which consists of moving dirt between the inside of the nest and the outside, will occur first; patrolling, which involves a shorter overall amount of time spent outside, will occur second; and foraging will be the final behavior.",3.1,3.1
"Finally, I will discuss a main method encoding the task switching between these behaviors.",3.0,2.88
The midden work behavior will be Antie’s default initial behavior.,3.14,3.14
"It will be initiated in the morning by the sunrise, and will continue until the outside temperature reaches 52­­­oC, at which point all red harvester ants must return to the nest.",2.9,3.1
"As previously stated, a midden worker must identify midden, grasp it, and carry it to the surface, depositing it halfway down the mound before returning to collect more midden.",2.9,2.7
A program encoding this behavior might look like this:,3.0,2.88
"These three behaviors each present different puzzles to the ant and to the modeler, though there is some overlap, particularly with navigational problems.",2.88,3.12
"The second behavior, patrolling, involves two sub-behaviors: nest patrolling and trail patrolling.",3.0,2.7
"Nest patrolling will involve leaving the nest, roaming around on the nest mound for a few minutes, and reentering the nest.",3.14,2.86
"This behavior will be implemented in two parts, with a task-switching algorithm based on age.",3.0,3.11
"Research shows that ants do change their behaviors based partly on their perceived life expectancy (Moron, et al, 2007), and that task-switching is partly genetically controlled by a switch in gene expression as the individual ages (Ingram, et al, 2005).",2.88,2.75
It is therefore reasonable to assign a constant age at which Antie will switch from nest patrolling to trail patrolling.,3.0,2.8
"In order to perform both of these functions, Antie will need a subroutine to explore in a zig-zag fashion, as harvester ants do (Gordon, 34).",2.88,3.0
"Harvester ants display a preference to wander in familiar territory, though foragers and patrollers do sometimes wander into other nests’ territories (Gordon, 57-60).",3.0,2.9
"In the case of midden work, Antie must be able to identify garbage, grasp it, carry it out of the nest, and deposit it about halfway down the mound before returning to repeat the process ad infinitum (or until stimulated to switch behaviors).",3.0,3.2
"To control for this behavior, Antie’s explore subroutine will display a preference for exploration in places where there is a low gradient of nestmate pheromones.",3.1,2.7
"This model is reasonable because patrollers and foragers change their explored territory from day to day, even though they do retain some more commonly chosen paths (Gordon, 45).",3.0,2.9
The code may look something like this:,3.0,3.0
"Patrolling may be divided into two distinct sub-behaviors, nest patrolling and trail patrolling.",3.0,3.0
Nest patrollers will only call this behavior for a short distance before returning to the nest to idle for a few minutes and exit again.,3.1,2.7
"Trail patrollers will go much further, until food sources are found, and will then orient towards the nest and create trails for the foragers to follow.",3.0,3.0
"An ant engaged in nest patrolling must exit the nest at the proper time in the morning and wander about for a bit on the nest mound, presumably taking measurements of the temperature and humidity in some way and making sure that it is safe for the other ants to exit.",3.0,3.0
A general site of food is all that the patroller need find; the foragers will dig through the sand for the food.,3.1,3.0
Code for the patrolling behavior might look like this (note that part is on a schema basis):,3.0,2.5
The integers nestpatrol_age and trailpatrol_age will represent the ages at which it is appropriate to switch to these tasks.,2.9,2.8
"Perhaps the level of degradation of the nest patrollers’ cuticular hydrocarbons after this short foray into the sun and heat acts as an indication of the outside conditions to the foragers, who may then, upon smelling the returning patroller, be stimulated either to forage or to remain inactive inside the nest.",3.0,3.0
"The final behavior, foraging, will involve one extra subroutine that will employ an algorithm designed by R.",3.0,2.89
Andrew Russell to localize an object through sand based on a chemical plume.,3.0,2.7
"This will emulate the digging that foragers must often do in order to locate seeds, and will enable Antie to accurately retrieve seeds for its host nest.",3.0,3.1
This algorithm will keep track of the last two intensities of the desired chemical input and compare them.,3.0,2.62
It would also keep track of whether the last rotation was clockwise or counter-clockwise.,3.0,2.9
"The code for this, adapted from Russell’s paper, might look like this:",3.0,2.83
"Foragers will follow trails marked by patrollers to their conclusion before collecting food to bring back to the nest, even if more tantalizing food presents itself in their path (Gordon, 47).",3.0,3.14
"To address this, a strict subsumption hierarchy will make sure that the foragers do not stop to collect food too soon.",3.0,2.86
The code might look like this:,3.0,2.8
"An ant engaged in trail patrolling must exit the nest, wander around searching for food sources, identify food upon discovery and return to the nest to show the foragers where the food is.",3.12,3.25
"Of course, what makes Antie an innovative robot is the task-switching between these larger behaviors.",3.1,2.9
"Because the midden work behavior is Antie’s initial default behavior, I will not address task switching to midden work.",2.9,2.9
"Workers probably switch to patrolling based on their perceived life expectancy and as a function of a gene whose expression changes between young and old ants, and this is easily emulated using a clock pulse counter in Antie’s CPU that will count its “age” since last boot.",3.0,2.9
"To remind the reader, this technique was implemented earlier in this proposal to create the limited task-switching between nest patrolling and trail patrolling.",3.0,2.9
"The switch from patrolling to foraging has been modeled as a function of successful foragers’ returns with great accuracy by Schafer, et al (2006), and evidence from experiments in which successful foragers were removed before reentry to the nest does support the theory that returning successful foragers have an effect on the activation of new foragers (Gordon, 2002).",3.2,3.0
"Infiltrating insect societies, however, is much simpler.",2.89,2.67
"This is thought to be accomplished by the deposition of chemical markers from a gland on the abdomen that the patroller drags along the ground on her return route to the nest that the foragers may then follow (Gordon, 33-34; Holldobler et al, 1990, as cited in Webb, 1998).",3.0,3.0
Activated foragers form a queue to exit the nest and exit at a steady rate.,3.0,2.8
"According to Schafer’s, et al. model of forager activation, every time a successful forager returns and no foragers are currently in line to exit, a fraction (modeled at 0.0035) of inactive foragers joins the queue.",3.0,2.88
"For the purposes of modeling Antie, I will assume that the switches between these behaviors are permanent, irreversible and partly a function of age, with new foragers being activated by returning successful foragers.",2.88,2.75
The code to model this task-switching might look something like this:,3.11,2.89
Conclusion,3.0,2.9
"Antie will be a fully autonomous, situated and embodied agent, infiltrating a red harvester ant colony and providing valuable information not only about the hypothesized rules of these ants’ behaviors and their task-switching thresholds, but also about the combination of complex behaviors into a single autonomous system with the ability to switch between behaviors as necessary.",3.2,3.3
"In addition to following these trails to the food, foragers must also be able to identify food, grasp it and carry it back to the nest.",3.0,3.14
"Biomimetic robots have long been a rich source of information for both biologists and robotics engineers, and complex robots that can switch tasks as the situation demands and communicate information about current tasks could be useful for further studies of complex robot behaviors as well as for the obvious practical applications of robot swarms, such as on the battlefield and standard building maintenance.",3.0,2.78
REFERENCES,3.0,2.9
"Ants engaged in all three behaviors must be able to identify other nestmates and their current tasks (as well as indicate to other ants their own nestmate status and current task), walk, navigate both within and outside of the nest, and of course switch tasks at appropriate times.",3.0,3.0
"Extensive research has been done on the interactions of social insects such as honeybees, ants and cockroaches, and in fact robots have passed undetected in cockroach society performing single simple behaviors already (Halloy et al, 2007).",3.1,2.8

"Antie be a circular robot, no more than 1cm in diameter (the length of a red harvester ant), with two driving wheels and one rear wheel for stabilization.",3.1,2.8
A gripper will be located on the front of the robot consisting of two elongated tongs.,3.11,2.89
"Antie will also feature a skirt of bump sensors, sonar detectors and chemical emitters, including sacs of hydrocarbons extracted from ants of the nest being infiltrated and pheromones for successful patrolling and foraging.",3.11,2.89
These sacs will be refilled at a filling station each morning as Antie determines that they are getting depleted.,3.11,2.67
Antie will likewise recharge at a special station at night just inside the nest entrance.,3.14,3.14
"For the purposes of this proposal, I will assume that Antie has enough battery life to remain powered the whole day.",3.0,2.7
A rudimentary blueprint of Antie is attached.,3.0,2.8
Sensors,3.0,3.0
"In order to inform itself about its environment, Antie will need a number of sensors.",3.0,3.0
"In an attempt to mimic the red harvester ant as closely as possible, these sensors include a thermometer, photoreceptors, bump sensors and sonar, a polarization compass, and a series of chemical receptors on a pair of stalks corresponding to the antennae.",3.09,2.73
"On its front grippers, Antie will have a tactile skin to sense pressure.",3.0,2.88
The locations of the rest of these sensors will depend on their function.,3.0,2.75
"The thermometer will be located on the rear of the robot to keep it out of the way, and will detect and input to the robot the outside temperature in degrees Celsius.",3.0,3.0
"Harvester ants do not exit the nest when the outside temperature is above 52 degrees Celsius (Gordon, 9), and the ability to use a temperature gradient will enable in-nest navigation.",3.0,2.83
Antie will also be equipped with one photoreceptor located in the middle of the top of its chassis corresponding to the ant’s eyes.,3.0,2.73
"These will be useful for initiating patrolling behavior in the morning and shutting off behaviors at night: the patrollers first poke their heads out of the nest shortly after sunrise and scuttle back in at night (Gordon, 5).",3.12,3.0
"No robot has yet been constructed, however, that could pass undetected within a colony of the red harvester ants species Pogonomyrmex barbatus; nor has a robot managed to pass undetected in a society of insects while combining in its design several different behaviors and the thresholds of stimulation required to switch between them.",2.9,3.0
The bump sensors and sonar will form a skirt around Antie to keep it from colliding with other objects.,3.1,3.1
"The sonar will constantly be detecting nearby objects and initiate an escape maneuver when their inputs pass a certain threshold of stimulation, and the bump sensors will, when depressed, also initiate the escape function.",3.0,3.3
"The sonar will correspond to the ant’s limited optical object detection ability, and the bump sensors will allow the robot to detect collisions.",3.1,3.1
"The polarization compass will consist of two polarized light sensors placed at 45 and -45 degrees from the center front of Antie, respectively, that will orient Antie towards a desired polarization pattern.",3.1,3.1
"These sensors would correspond to the cells in the ants’ eyes sensitive to polarized light, and research has shown that many insects, including ants, do navigate using a path integration system synthesizing input from a polarization compasses and from a sort of odometer (Labhart, et al, 2002).",2.9,3.0
"Antie would use a system for processing the input from its polarization compass based on the compass designed by Lambrinos, Moller, Labhart, Pfeifer and Wehner in 2000, consisting of two photodiodes with blue filters and polarizers.",3.0,2.75
"The difference of their logarithmized signals would be returned to Antie, who will use a simultaneous model to navigate returns to the nest: Upon each exit from the nest, Antie will take a single 360o scan of the sky, and will orient itself according to an analytical procedure to derive compass information from different polarization patterns perceived later.",3.0,2.56
"This should be sufficient to return Antie to the nest, given the accuracy achieved by Lambrinos, et al and the relatively short periods of time that harvester ants spend outside the nest before returning.",3.0,2.75

"So the Bush administration can keep claiming that we are safer now, under their policies.",3.0,3.0
"But this claim is merely feel-good propaganda, intended to keep the neo-cons in power.",2.9,3.2
It cannot withstand clear-headed scrutiny.,2.7,3.2
"The fact is, Bush policies have failed completely even to diminish terrorism, much less defeat it.",2.0,3.0
"By trying to ""stamp out"" terrorism by killing terrorists, Bush and Israel have made things infinitely worse for us: more dangerous, not safer.",2.1,3.4

"TERRORISM is ""the systematic use of violence to create a general climate of fear in a population and thereby to bring about a particular political objective.",2.9,3.1
"We believe that any terrorist act is a crime against humanity and against the will of God, because it deliberately intends to injure and kill innocent people.",2.4,3.0

"Without motivation, terrorism will quickly die down, like a plant without water.",2.9,3.0
"We completely reject the idea that terrorism can be defeated by brute force, because brute force radicalizes the moderates, and they then join the terrorists.",2.8,3.1
So you end up fighting the entire population.,2.7,3.3
"Brute force has failed in Palestine, and it is failing in Iraq.",2.8,3.1
"We try to be even-handed in opposing all terrorism, although we recognize that the greatest terrorist threat in the world today comes from radical Muslims who falsely believe that Allah approves of their criminal behavior against Israel, The United States, Russia, India, the Philippines, Australia, and others whom they falsely believe to be ""waging war against Allah.",2.8,3.3
"And the second-greatest terrorist threat comes from several countries, mainly Israel, who sometimes resort to terrorism themselves, claiming ""self-defense,"" as they desperately try to prevent further attacks by radical Muslims.",2.6,3.1
"In all of these cases above, if the radical Muslims would cease their attacks, all terrorism on both sides of every dispute would quickly end.",2.7,3.1
"Beyond these two sources, there is virtually no terrorist activity in the world, with the possible exception of localized disputes such as in Northern Ireland and occasional domestic episodes in various places involving isolated disaffected groups.",2.92,3.0
"The number and severity of terrorist attacks worldwide has increased dramatically, as has the number of active terrorists.",2.3,3.1
The moral and religious theories which support terrorism are quite faulty and erroneous.,2.7,3.1

"Paul Wilson describes the transition from the Introduction to the Exposition as “quite abrupt and seemingly unmotivated,”",2.7,3.1
"Wilson, 173.",3.0,2.71
but it is in fact this motivic relationship that ties them together and creates a rather smooth transition.,3.1,2.9
The Exposition,3.0,2.88
"Although the motivic relationship between the Introduction and the first theme of the exposition smooth the transition, nearly every other element changes when the first theme appears.",3.0,2.5
Harmonic Structure and Form,3.2,2.7
The drastic tempo and meter changes as well as the first appearances of staccato articulations make it clear to the listener that the introduction is over.,2.9,3.1
"As mentioned, the first theme, the beginning of which is reproduced in Example 8, contains two head motives: the first is the tritone-spanning ascent that appears in the first measure, and the second is an iteration of the interval cell (+5, -2, +5) that appears in the second through third measures.",3.0,2.71
Bartók describes the form of the first movement as “more or less regular sonata form.”,3.0,3.0
"While the presence of the perfect fourths that was so prevalent in the Introduction is clear in the latter, the former does not employ the perfect fourth in its formation.",3.0,2.64
"Rather, this motive is a small-scale representation of the tonic-dominant relationship of tritone partners, specifically F and B, that is the basis for the harmonic structure of this movement.",3.0,2.9
"Rhythmically, we have a dissonance between the melody, which follows the written meter, and the accompanying chords in the bassoons, horns and lower strings.",3.0,2.8
"Example 9 reproduces the chords, and Example 10 rewrites them in a meter that is more consistent with their rhythmic pattern.",3.0,2.88
"As Example 10 shows, the chords are more-or-less in duple meter (4/8 and 2/8) with one “hiccup” occurring in the 5/8 measure.",3.1,2.9
This is in strict metric dissonance with the triple meter of the melody (with its own “hiccups” occurring in the written 2/8 measures).,3.0,2.55
"As we will later see, this dissonance disappears when this theme returns in the recapitulation.",2.86,3.0
"While that does not seem to be a meaningful assertion, it is perfectly accurate: the movement is in sonata form, but there is an introduction that does not relate thematically to any other parts of the movement (not unheard of in Mozart sonatas), and the recapitulation presents the two themes of the exposition in reverse order.",3.0,3.0
"We have already mentioned that the first theme group is in F—this is made clear from the onset, both in the melodic line and by the F minor triad that occurs on the downbeat of measure 77.",2.9,2.7
"While the material occasionally departs from this F in measures 76-94, these departures are all subordinate to the prolonged F.",3.0,2.9
"E♭ is the tonal center for measures 95-134, although it does not appear as a strong bass note until measure 131.",3.0,3.0
"Measures 95-130 contain a mostly chromatic descent from C to E♭, where E♭ is anticipated throughout as a goal tone for the bass.",3.0,3.2
Example 11 illustrates this structure.,3.0,2.8
"Immediately following the arrival of E♭ in the bass, C♯ (D♭) is established as the tonal center for the final transition to the second theme.",3.14,2.86
"The trombone motive in measures 134-141, shown in Example 12, is the subject of the fugato section in part 3 of the development, although its importance is downplayed here.",3.0,2.67
"Note that the initial G♯ is a pickup to the section in C♯, which fills in the whole-tone descent from E♭ to C♯ with the intervening fourth.",3.0,2.88
"This motive also contains the intervallic cell of the second head motive of the first theme in the form of G♯-C♯-B-E (with the addition of some passing tones), in addition to consisting largely of motion by perfect fourths.",3.0,2.9
Wilson claims that C and E♭ are “local dominants” to F in this first section of the exposition.,3.0,3.11
"While the strong V-I motion from measures 90-91 does carry a tonal implication of dominant-tonic, such cadential bass motion does not imply anything about structural function in this context.",3.0,2.89
"E♭, furthermore, is not convincingly established as a dominant-functioning tone at all.",2.9,3.2
"The passage from measures 85-89 is centered on E♭ (and the pentatonic set from the opening of the exposition is transposed down a whole step), but its mere presence as local tonic does not signify any sort of dominant function.",3.0,2.7
"Rather, we can consider this occurrence of E♭ as a middleground-level whole-tone descent that foreshadows the structural descent to E♭ at measure 131 that is represented in Example 2.",3.0,3.0
"In measures 91-95, the bass descends F-E♭-D♭-C, which might seem to support C’s functioning as structural dominant.",3.0,2.7
"However, as previously mentioned, C acts as a “fake” dominant that in measures 149-155 actually functions as an upper neighbor to B, the “true” dominant.",3.0,2.86
"The descent in measures 91-95 in fact participates in the farce by projecting a descent ending on C, which makes the eventual reinterpretation of C and descent to B stronger.",3.1,2.9
"This creates both a smooth transition to the second theme and a strong sense that a new section is beginning, a combination that is generally rather difficult to forge.",3.0,3.1
"The second theme is tranquil and harmonically simple, which is in stark contrast to the first theme.",3.14,2.86
B dominates as tonal center from measures 155-191 with little or no harmonic motion away from it.,2.88,2.75
The “backwards” recapitulation is a technique that Bartók employs frequently because of the formal symmetry it creates.,3.0,2.86
"Measures 192-197 are in E♭, with the bass notes in the harp, and measures 198-209 are in D♭.",2.9,3.1
A♭ intervenes between E♭ and D♭ in measure 195—another instance of the whole-tone being “filled in” by a fourth.,3.0,2.38
The return to B in measure 210 is also filled-in in this way by F♯ in measures 208-209.,3.0,2.6
"Hence, measures 155-210 constitute the bass progression B-E♭-D♭-B; the same stepwise descent (E♭-D♭) occurred in the first theme group while F rather than B was being prolonged.",3.0,2.6
"Paul Wilson points out that “[i]n substituting for F within an analogous structure, B receives confirmation at this point as the crucial interior center of the movement.”",3.0,2.8
"“[i]n substituting for F within an analogous structure, B receives confirmation at this point as the crucial interior center of the movement.”",3.0,3.0
"In our terminology, this is the point at which B is unequivocally established as the structural dominant.",3.0,3.0
The Development,3.18,2.73
"As mentioned, the development is divided into three subsections.",3.0,2.9
"In Example 2, the entire development section is represented by exactly three pitches, and indeed each subsection is associated with one of these three pitches as its tonal center—none of these pitches is involved in the structural whole-tone descent.",3.0,2.88
"As Paul Wilson states, the development “is, for Bartók’s music, developmental in a relatively conventional way”; the themes from the exposition are expanded and modified, and tonalities other than those expected arise.",3.18,3.09
"“is, for Bartók’s music, developmental in a relatively conventional way”",3.0,2.75
"For example, the fifth string quartet.",3.0,2.57
"The only slight abnormality, though it is certainly not unheard of even in classical-period sonata movements, is the emergence of a new theme in the second section of the development.",3.0,2.9
"Although Wilson claims that this theme is based on “a transformation in rhythm and contour of the second head-motive of [the first-theme],”",3.0,3.0
"“a transformation in rhythm and contour of the second head-motive of [the first-theme],”",3.0,2.75
"Also see Bartók’s comments on that (Bartók, 414).",3.0,2.9
"Wilson, 182.",3.0,2.9
"there is no intervallic relationship between the two motives, and it is not clear what elements of a motive remain when rhythm, contour and interval content are changed.",2.88,2.75
"Before beginning an analysis of any piece by Béla Bartók, one must first decide to what degree tonal analysis will be used.",3.0,3.0
"Furthermore, this section, being the middle section of the movement, upholds the formal symmetry if interpreted as its own theme.",3.0,3.1
"The first section of the development, measures 231-271, begins with a big D-minor chord which immediately establishes D as the tonal center for the section.",2.86,3.0
"Although it moves to E♭ minor in measure 239, it returns to D minor in measure 248, which suggests that E♭ is an upper neighbor prolonging D.",3.0,3.0
Example 1 shows a diagram of the form of the movement; the symmetry is apparent within the seven sections following the introduction.,3.0,2.75
"The passage beginning at measure 248, shown in Example 13, can be considered to be the “theme” of this section, and is a development of the second head motive of the first theme.",3.0,3.0
This motive undergoes inversion and extension throughout the section.,3.0,2.75
"While Wilson rightly identifies the resultant set of measures 261-264 as 6-Z50 ([014679]), identifying it as such does not offer much analytical insight until we point out that this is a simple extension of the intervallic sequence (+5, -2, +5) from the original motive.",3.0,2.8
The second section of the development is in C♯ (which is sometimes spelled D♭).,2.9,2.6
This section is reproduced as Example 14.,3.0,2.88
"This section returns to the calm simplicity (and tempo) of the second section, though apart from affect there are no references to that section.",3.0,2.88
"Although the C♯ major chord in measure 293, preceded by A♭ major (V) in measure 285, suggests C♯ as tonal center, the tonality is not strongly established until measure 303.",3.0,3.11
"The arrival at C♯ was foreshadowed by the first two measures of the development (Example 15), which are almost a direct transposition of the two head motives of the first theme to C♯.",2.8,2.8
"Because of its emphasis here in the development section and its position as leading to B in the second theme group, we could conceive of C# as a sub-dominant in this movement.",3.0,2.82
"As the example shows, the development section is divided into three subsections; the first and third subsections draw their thematic material from the first theme group, and the second subsection involves new material not drawn from the exposition.",3.0,3.0
"As tempting as this interpretation may be, this observation is relegated to the notes section because it constitutes a horrible abuse of terminology—there is only so far that such tonal analogies can go before they begin to hide any true analytical insight behind misused terms.",2.7,3.3
"The third section of the development takes the trombone motive from the transition between the first and second sections of the exposition shown in Example 12, transposed to begin on F, and turns it into a fugato sequence, reproduced in Example 17.",3.0,3.12
The tonal center B♭ is established immediately in measures 316-318 by the strong V-I chord progression (Example 16).,3.0,2.75
"As previously mentioned, the fugato motive incorporates the motion by perfect fourths found in the Introduction as well as the intervallic cell found in the second head motive of the first theme.",3.0,3.12
The resultant set is the pentatonic set F-B♭-E♭-A♭-D♭; the entire passage shown in Example 17 remains within this set.,3.0,2.7
"The second and fourth entrances of the fugato subject are transposed up a perfect fifth, but the first note is B♭ rather than C, which allows Bartók to remain in this pentatonic set (and also to reinforce B♭ as tonal center).",3.0,2.89
"The second instance of the fugato section, not reproduced in its entirety but based on the subject in Example 18, is an exact pitch inversion transposed to begin on C.",3.0,2.44
The inversion blends seamlessly back into the original subject in measure 363.,3.2,2.8
"The following section (measures 363-389) especially brings out the quartal harmonies within the pentatonic set, so much so that B♭ is obscured as tonal center which allows A♭ to emerge as the goal tone of this section—only to be immediately reinterpreted as a leading tone to the A that begins the recapitulation.",3.0,2.55
"Both B♭ and A♭ are chromatic neighbors to A, which intensifies the arrival on A, and brings out the fact that the appearance of A continues the large-scale whole-tone descent that has been left stranded on B for the entire development section.",3.0,2.88
"Hence, on either side of the middle section of the development we have the alternation FTG-STG-FTG which makes the overall form, with the exception of the Introduction, symmetric.",3.0,3.0
The Recapitulation,3.1,3.1
"The recapitulation, as we have seen, presents the themes in reverse order.",3.0,2.6
"The second theme is initially presented in A, as part of the whole-tone descent, and proceeds directly to G, where it is restated slightly modified.",3.0,3.0
"It is worth pointing out that the arrival on G at measure 425 is led into by D, which constitutes another “filling in” of the whole-step by the intervening fourth.",3.0,3.0
"The A♯ in measure 438 might initially seem to be a new tonal area, but it leads to D in measure 444, which constitutes a V chord still applied to G.",3.0,2.87
"Rather than resolve this D back to G, however, Bartók shifts briefly to F♯ in measure 456 and leads to E in measure 467.",3.1,3.1
"E and F♯ are both active throughout the entire transition from second theme back to first theme (measures 456-487) which brings out their functions as upper and lower chromatic neighbors to F, which returns triumphantly in measure 488 with the much-anticipated recapitulation of the first theme.",3.38,3.25
"The return of the first theme is certainly immediately recognized as such; however, there are some important differences.",3.0,3.0
"Firstly, its initial appearance in the exposition had a minor flare to it; the first chord in Example 9 is an F-minor triad, and the first four notes of Example 8 ascend the F-minor scale.",3.1,2.6
"In the recapitulation of this theme, shown in Example 19, the first chord is an F-major chord, and the A♭ is replaced by A♮ in the melody.",2.91,2.82
"In fact, the chord progression of the first four measures of Example 19 can be thought of tonally as I-vi-V in F major—while we are reluctant to say that this passage is in major (the conspicuous A♭ in measure 490 easily brings doubt to this interpretation), we can certainly say that the minor flare of the beginning has been replaced by a major flare here in the recapitulation.",3.0,3.0
"Paul Wilson also discusses the inherent symmetry of the movement, although his interpretation is somewhat different.",3.0,2.9
"In addition to the “mode”-shift, we notice that the metric dissonance shown in Examples 9 and 10 no longer appears (notice how regular the rhythm of the accompanying figure is in Example 19) and also that the written meter no longer changes.",3.1,2.8
"In other words, the piece, in becoming more regular, is beginning to drive towards the finish—because of the formal structure, the recapitulation of the first theme also serves as the closing section of the movement.",3.1,2.8
"Indeed, this section has the feel of a Coda to it—it is much shorter than any other major section or subsection, and the tonic harmony is active throughout.",3.1,2.9
"See Wilson, 168-170.",3.0,2.8
Bartók is one of the many early-twentieth century composers whose music fits entirely in the gray area between tonality and atonality.,3.12,3.25
"While we know from his writings that he often composed with a tonal centers and relationships in mind, and that he regularly applied tonal structures and forms to his compositions, by merely glancing at any one of his pieces we can see that tonality as it is understood in the common practice period is not at work.",3.1,3.1
"Thanks largely to the work of tonal theorists such as Heinrich Schenker and others, we have a detailed system for analyzing tonal music—their system, however, is virtually useless in analyzing music that falls entirely on the atonal side of the spectrum.",3.2,3.1
"But if we apply it to music such as Bartók’s that is in the middle area, we can come up with some enlightening and perhaps unexpected results.",3.1,3.0
To do so was the goal of this analysis of the first movement of the Concerto for Orchestra.,3.0,2.8
"By applying our tonal system to music that slips outside of the tonal realm, we not only find the elements of tonality that do remain, but we also pinpoint exactly when and how this music breaks from previous conventions.",3.1,2.7
It is not disputed that Bartók’s music has great expressive power—perhaps now we can understand why.,3.18,3.0
References,3.0,2.89
"The abbreviations FTG and STG stand for First Theme Group and Second Theme Group, respectively.",3.0,2.75
"While “tonality” in this piece (and in Bartók’s music in general) is quite different from its classical interpretation, we find that the harmonic structure is at least analogous to the standard sonata-form structure.",3.1,2.8
"Bartók’s music, although it is often difficult to call completely tonal, never entirely sheds itself of tonal elements and structure.",2.88,2.88
"To begin with, the movement is in F.",3.0,2.88
"When we say “in F,” we do not imply F major (or minor, for that matter)—the major/minor tonal system in general does not apply to this piece—but rather that the pitch-class F is the tonal center of the movement, and acts analogously to the tonic in a Mozartian sonata movement.",3.0,2.9
"Using this interpretation, we can map out the local tonics (tonal centers) used throughout the movement, as shown in Example 2.",3.0,2.5
Tonal Structure and Form in Bartók’s Concerto for Orchestra (I),3.0,2.57
"In this example, the barlines divide the formal sections of the piece (Introduction–Exposition–Development­–Recapitulation)—so we can immediately see that the tonic F is not established until the exposition begins.",3.1,3.2
"Beginning with the exposition, the large-scale progression of tonal centers is a whole-tone descent from F to F, represented by the stemmed notes in Example 2, while the Introduction ascends from C♯ to F through D♯ (shown as D♭ and E♭ in the graph) in a quasi-bass Anstieg.",3.29,2.86
"The middle pitch of the descent, B, acts as the “dominant” to F, based on its symmetrical division of the whole-tone scale and the fact that the second theme appears in B in the exposition.",3.0,2.56
"This remains true even with one of his last compositions, the Concerto for Orchestra, written two years before his death in 1943.",2.8,2.7
"Bartók has often applied a tonic-dominant relationship to a pitch-class and its tritone partner, and even admits to using that as a compositional framework in his fifth string quartet.",2.9,2.9
"See Bartók, 414-415.",3.0,2.78
"In this particular movement, Bartók feigns moving to the tonal dominant, C, for the second theme before reinterpreting C as a chromatic passing tone between D♭ and B—this and other subtleties shown in Example 2 will be explained in detail in later sections.",2.9,2.9
Our analysis will focus instead on relating the foreground activity to the overarching background structure.,3.0,2.75
"The graph in Example 2 will serve as a point of departure for the subsequent analysis; while we will periodically refer back to some of its specific elements, it should be understood that even when not explicitly referenced, this graph serves as the explanatory goal of this paper.",3.0,2.6
The Introduction,3.0,2.78
"As Paul Wilson points out, the title “Introduzione” given to the movement as a whole seems to apply only to the first 75 measures.",3.0,2.9
"The discussion that follows analyzes the first movement of the Concerto, focusing on the tonal structures at play throughout the movement.",3.0,2.9
"The Introduction does not relate thematically to any of the main sections of the movement—in fact, it is the third movement that draws its thematic material from this section—but the harmonic and motivic principles at play here foreshadow some important elements of the entire piece.",3.0,3.0
"To begin with, the opening motive in the celli and basses, shown in Example 3, outlines a pentatonic set and strongly presents C♯ as the tonal center.",3.0,2.9
"The pentatonic set here is exclusively a pitch-class set, and its incarnations throughout the movement are devoid of any connotations associated with the pentatonic scale.",3.0,2.9
"Indeed, this set can be seen more as a by-product of stacked perfect fourths than a generative element itself.",2.9,2.5
"The perfect fourth in fact generates much of the motivic and harmonic material of the entire movement, and its importance is immediately evident in the Introduction with the opening bass motive.",3.12,2.88
"Furthermore, the following two instances of this opening motive, shown in Examples 4 and 5, remove any doubt as to the motivic importance of the perfect fourth, and in turn diminish the importance of the pentatonic set.",3.0,2.63
"Example 4 transitions from C♯ to F♯, and adds pitch-class E to the pentatonic set of Example 3, creating a six-note set of stacked fourths.",3.1,2.8
Example 5 shows the true dominance of the perfect fourth; the set created is a ten-note set derived by stacking fourths.,2.9,2.9
If we begin from the final D♯ and ascend the circle of fourths until we reach C we obtain the entire set presented in this example.,3.0,3.0
"Each note is either approached or left (or both) by a fourth, and the structural motion is from F♯ to D♯.",3.0,2.9
"The overall motion in the first 29 measures is C♯ to D♯, through F♯; these are represented enharmonically in Example 2 as D♭, E♭ and G♭.",3.1,3.0
"As previously mentioned, this motion constitutes the initial ascent to what will eventually be a whole-tone descent from F to F.",2.8,2.9
So the prevailing structural motion of the movement as a whole is a descending whole step and the prevailing melodic motion is a (usually ascending) perfect fourth.,3.1,3.1
"We can connect the two by noting that the descending whole step consists of two ascending fourths; indeed, the structural whole-tone descent is often “filled in” with the intervening fourth.",2.9,2.9
This motion is exemplified in Example 2 in the second theme group (mm.,3.0,3.0
We will also examine to what degree a “tonal” reading of this movement is limited in its analytical potential in an attempt to pinpoint exactly where Bartók strays from common-practice compositional techniques.,3.0,2.86
"155-233), and as we will see, it occurs in other places, though not relevant enough to the background structure to be represented in Example 2.",3.0,2.8
"Each time the motion in Examples 3 through 5 breaks from chains of fourths, the same sequence of intervals occurs: two descending perfect fourths separated by an ascending major second (-5, +2, -5); each instance of this intervallic cell is bracketed in the examples.",3.1,2.9
"This sequence of intervals is the inversion of those found in the second head motive of the first theme of the exposition, shown in measures 2-3 of Example 8.",3.0,2.9
"So although there is no thematic relation between the Introduction and the main sections of the movement, within the first 29 measures we can already see structural, harmonic and motivic elements that apply to the movement as a whole.",3.0,3.11
"The section from measures 35-50 is centered on E; upon the return of D♯, enharmonically respelled as E♭, in measure 58, we see that E acts as its upper-neighbor.",3.0,2.71
"This relationship is somewhat obscured by measures 51-57 however; while there is no clear tonal center for this section, G appears in the outer voices in measure 51, although the harmonic material is reminiscent of C minor.",3.0,2.67
"The concluding motive of this section in the violins (the bracketed sections of Example 6), as well as the bass motive of measure 58ff.",3.0,2.9
"(Example 7), are related to the first head motive of the first theme, which is shown in the first measure of Example 8.",3.0,2.7
"All three of these motives span a tritone, which as mentioned is the “dominant” relationship in this movement.",3.0,2.6
Because of this it is possible to take up any given colors and make them harmonize,3.12,3.0
For this reason white walls are favored over colored ones for both galleries and architectural spaces.,3.13,2.75
Why in a world filled with color do we feel the need to purge it from our space?,2.8,2.8
The white of the walls intensifies the color of what is set before them.,3.12,3.38
It stabilizes and controls forms because it brings to light the contours of the space.,2.9,2.9
"“In the white painted room the clarity of spatial sensation and disposition was surest and most convincing, all the details of the form and color of the furnishings could be developed undisturbed in front of this background…In this a form was discovered which was completely convincing in its simplicity and which could be seen as one of the essential formulas for wall treatment in “closed” spaces”",3.0,2.78
"In the 19th century it became fashionable for bourgeois women to dress in white, while men dressed in black (Wigley).",3.0,2.6
What exactly is the debate between colorlessness vs color and more specifically can black and white be considered non-colors?,2.9,3.1
"These distinctions proved a certain rational order, only attained by those able to afford of it.",2.75,3.0
"White walls, white clothing, they both require much more maintenance than something colored where a stain can merely hide away among the other colors.",3.0,2.62
"Crisp whiteness on the other hand expresses a sort of luxury, and leisure.",3.4,3.1
"White clothing proved that someone was of a level of society in which they were not forced to work, for the clothing would immediately become soiled if not and thus the reason why women who were the ones to stay at home dressed in all white, while men who were the ones to go out and work wore black, for black did in fact hide stains.",3.1,2.9
"The same goes with white walls, in their impeccability it proved to whoever, that the owner could afford to not live actually live in this space, or could afford more simply for the upkeep and constant fresh coats of paint.",3.0,3.11
Both as well were signs of the modern age man had reached.,3.22,3.22
"“Pure white was de rigueur, partly because of its exciting novelty, partly because it emphasized the smoothly mechanical texture, and pointed the contrast between it and surrounding nature”",3.09,2.82
The use of white was proof that man had conquered nature.,3.29,3.43
"The use of white and black in dress and architecture also became a way of distinguishing oneself from the vulgar, normal, lower classes.",2.9,2.9
"Ever since the dawn of man, human society has evolved in ways which attempt to ultimately control nature.",3.0,3.0
"Furthermore, with the advent of industrialization the invention of new synthetic dyes meant that color in dress became democratized for all classes.",3.0,2.63
"Now, anyone could afford to wear colorful clothing and the masses began to dress themselves in what once would have been inconceivable to them.",3.5,3.5
"Thus said, the use of black in white in wardrobe perhaps was a way for the new bourgeoisie to distinguish themselves from the decadence of the upper class and the vulgarity from the low.",3.0,2.9
"“In the prevailing styles of the European bourgeoisie, there long survived a tendency to limit the use of color, with strong emphasis on what are generally thought of as non colors, such as white, black and gray”",2.9,2.8
"Seeing as color is something of the natural world, age old and archaic, washing it away from our lives is the ultimate form of rising above the physical world.",3.1,2.9
Another reason why it is believed that the bourgeoisie took preference in black and white is because of the Victorian sobriety of the age and their obsession with purity and cleanliness.,3.0,2.86
"Wearing black and white also marked the distinction of labor between men and women and in a highly rigid and segmented society, the wearing of different colors seemed the most obvious way to do so.",2.9,2.9
This simplicity of dress was seen as a mark of the modern man.,3.11,3.0
Other major technologies during the age of industrialization also had an effect on this preference for black and white.,3.0,3.0
"Photography took over as a means of portraiture for the bourgeois and the upper class and despite the fact that it was possible to color the photographs, for the most part they were left in black and white because it was seen as more “natural”.",3.2,3.1
"Above all, it is believed that the expanse of literacy and the printed word, mainly the newspaper, had a profound effect in influencing the choice of black and white.",3.33,3.33
"“This world was viewed as orderly and relatively uniform, a world in “black and white”",3.14,3.14
"This led to the idea of writing = rationality = production that confined images, especially images in color, to the emerging field of “art”, which was understood as an essential activity but one that was essentially unproductive, while it assigned to the two-toned and orderly world of printed paper the role of a daily guide to existence”",3.0,2.9
"“Intelligent beings have a language represented by articulate sounds; organized beings, like all animals and vegetables, express themselves by cries or forms, contour or carriage.",3.09,3.37
Black and white became a symbol for the superiority of man’s intellect and technology.,3.12,3.12
"This then translated down into the world of fashion, as seen with the distinction between black and white clothing, as well as art, namely photography but also film and as discussed before architecture and gallery space.",3.0,2.75
"Seeing as since the time of Aristotle, form was valued over that of color, the arts which did not require color to be enjoyed were perceived to be that of a higher form.",3.09,2.91
The explosion of mass production and printing allowed for a plethora of colorful advertising and consumer goods which came to be known as kitsch.,3.33,3.33
“Kitsch is a product of the industrial revolution which urbanized the masses of Western Europe and America and established what is called universal literacy”,3.3,3.2
In order to meet the demand of mass markets cheap and bright things of little use were made to attract the attention of consumers.,3.0,3.12
Kitsch made cheap what once was truly cultural by the way it reproduced it d infinitum.,3.0,2.9
"Greenberg continues by saying, “Kitsch, using for raw material the debased and academicized simulacra of genuine culture, welcomes and cultivates this insensibility.",3.0,2.67
It is the source of its profits. Kitsch is mechanical and operates by formulas.,3.25,2.75
Kitsch is vicarious experience and faked sensations.,2.5,2.8
"Kitsch changes according to style, but remains always the same.",3.0,2.75
Kitsch is the epitome of all that is spurious in the life of our times.,2.9,3.0
Kitsch pretends to demand nothing of its customers except their money -- not even their time”.,2.8,3.1
With the advent of kitsch came a great need for the distinction between higher and lower artforms.,3.1,2.8
"Avant guard at the time was considered to be true art, while this kitsch was simply pure imitation.",2.9,2.6
Inorganic nature has only the language of color.,3.0,3.0
"Thus said, this along with the influence of black and white print perhaps was the cause for the belief that which was black and white was deemed a serious, high art, while that which was colorful was mere rubbish and imitation for the lower classes.",2.8,3.2
"Of course during the early stages of color film and photography, the quality was so poor that it gave a cheap look, whereas black and white film really allowed one to see the light and the shadows in the images.",3.1,3.1
For the play of light and form was key in demonstrating the true art form.,3.1,2.9
"It is by color alone that a certain stone tells us it is a sapphire or emerald… color, then, is the peculiar characteristic of the lower forms of nature, while drawing becomes the medium of expression, more and more dominant, the higher we rise in the scale of being”",3.1,3.0
"That was what made up the essence of an image, not the artificial, or superficial filling in of form with color.",3.09,2.82
Color was thought to distract the viewer from the soul of the image.,2.9,2.9
These beliefs have changed since color technology as tweeked to the point of being almost better than reality.,3.0,2.7
Still though black and white is seen as something of a more sober tradition.,3.0,3.0
These non colors allow for the appreciation of color.,3.2,2.9
"When something is black and white, it allows the mind to fill in and imagine for itself the amazing colors that must exist beyond the screen.",3.0,3.1
Many actually complained with the invention of color in movies that this stunted the mind since one was forced to look at the garish colors placed before them.,2.8,2.9
It is for this reason that ultimately the use of black and white is seen as more of an intellectual process.,3.0,2.9
"Whether it mean going beyond the mind or simply the purity of non color, the use of black and white has been debated over for the last hundred years.",2.71,2.86
"Now we have entered an era where we are seeing once again more color, but perhaps it is human instinct, to want to surpass and rebel against generations before, so possibly we shall return to a state of non color veneration.",3.0,2.8
Thus is the ebb and flow of life.,3.0,2.8
"The world is made up of a myriad of colors. color gives distinction to our life, it gives flavor and meaning.",3.14,2.71
"In the Far East, reaching a state of colorless-ness is associated with the highest state of spiritual being, the state of Zen.",3.0,2.8
What is typical of this sort of ascetism is the art of expressing as much as possible using the minimum as an ideal.,3.11,2.89
This is apparent through Japanese haiku as well as the art of ink painting in both China and Japan.,3.0,2.6
"For them, reaching the greatest depths of spirituality demanded expression in its most minimal form.",2.91,2.91
"This reduction of color and expression proved the purity the artist had reached within himself, it was a means of reducing down to the essence of a thing.",3.4,2.6
"In the Elimination of color in the Far East, Izutsu explains though how this ultimate state of minimalism can only be reached through an appreciation and fine knowledge of color.",3.0,3.0

Thus originated Las Vegas’s reputation as an adult theme park.,3.2,3.4
"The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases: sprawling collections of grasses, trees, and wildlife.",3.11,2.78
Additional catalysts for the valley’s growth came from World War II.,3.0,2.89
"Both the Las Vegas Aerial Gunnery School (which became Nellis Air Force Base and the Nevada Test Site) in the north, and Basic Magnesium in the nearby town of Henderson, arrived in the early 1940s as a result of America’s war effort.",3.14,2.71
"By 1945, the population had grown to almost 20,000, with workers and airmen moving in at a rapid pace.",3.14,2.86

But the Mafia bosses who financed the operation were displeased with its performance; Siegel was murdered in the summer of 1947.,2.2,3.1
Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis.,3.1,3.1
"Despite its initial failings, Siegel’s Flamingo survived him, as did mob infiltration of casinos.",3.0,2.86

"Though Las Vegas had developed a powerful local economy, few major outside investments were made in the city, due primarily to mob infiltration and its inherent ties to illegal activities.",2.9,3.1
That would change dramatically with the 1966 arrival of billionaire Howard Hughes.,3.0,3.0
"Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley.",3.0,3.0
"A legitimate businessman, Hughes was nonetheless eccentric and dramatic, a style suited to the Las Vegas ethos.",3.2,3.1
"True to the myth, the reclusive Hughes immediately cloistered himself in the Desert Inn’s penthouse.",2.83,3.0
"Several weeks later he was asked — then ordered — to vacate the room to make room for high rollers, whereupon he promptly bought the property and fired the management.",2.8,3.0

"Hughes’ actions would have beneficial repercussions, both immediate and lasting.",2.88,3.25
"Because of the new legitimacy Las Vegas acquired from Hughes’ investments, established companies such as Hilton Hotels bought into the gaming business, and their influence helped draw a line in the desert sand between legitimate operations and mob casinos, where illegal skimming of profits was rampant.",3.1,3.2
"That, combined with the formation of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, would signal the beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in the city.",3.0,3.0
Las Vegas with a Vision,3.22,3.0
"As corporations moved in and the mob was slowly pushed out, a new Las Vegas emerged.",3.3,3.3
"Far more progressive than the Archaics, the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest.",3.25,2.88
The legitimization of gambling led to its increased legalization across the US.,3.0,3.12
What was once a sure thing became much more competitive.,2.7,3.1
Casino operators had to reassess the nature of their business.,2.89,2.89
"The first to really do so was Steve Wynn, a Las Vegas resident and owner of the Golden Nugget.",3.0,3.0
"In the mid-1980s, Wynn began plans to reinvigorate Las Vegas with a new resort.",3.2,2.9
He bought several Strip properties — the Silver Slipper and Castaways among them — and demolished them to make way for a new kind of resort — Mirage —  which became an instant success.,3.29,3.29
"Wynn’s demolition of the existing properties started a trend that, more than any other, describes Las Vegas at the end of the 20th century: removal of old properties in exchange for the potential of new ones.",3.0,3.0
"This trend has led to many more demolitions, including the Dunes (replaced by Bellagio), Aladdin (the new Aladdin) and Sands (Venetian) hotels.",2.91,2.64
Wynn’s casinos have also set new standards.,3.0,2.9
"They can no longer be just a box filled with gaming tables, restaurants, and a showroom.",2.9,3.1
"Excalibur, the MGM Grand, the Luxor, and New York-New York all followed Mirage’s lead during the 1990s, offering themed environments and attractions for families.",3.2,3.1
"As evidence of the “ever-faster” nature of the city, by the middle of the 1990s the new approach showed signs of backlash, with many visitors criticizing the mediocrity of the Las Vegas experience.",2.6,2.9
This permitted the Anasazi to achieve a benchmark of advanced society — the ability to live in permanent shelters year-round without need to follow wildlife.,3.1,2.9
The latest approach is perhaps the best of the post-mob era: the comprehensive resort.,3.0,3.1
"New resorts offer attractions and amenities modeled after those available in top resort cities worldwide, including luxurious spas, signature restaurants, and exclusive boutiques.",3.5,2.8
"Additionally, a handful of resorts — such as the South-Seas themed Mandalay Bay, the Mirage, and the new Four Seasons — are now catering exclusively to the luxury travel market.",3.3,3.1
The crème de la crème of Las Vegas deluxe is Steve Wynn’s Bellagio.,3.1,3.2
"Perhaps more important, such high-end accommodations raise the standards of expectations back to the mythology of the Rat Pack era.",3.22,3.33
"As it changed from mob gam bling town to corporate gaming venue, the population of Las Vegas skyrocketed.",3.1,3.3
"Over 20,000 additional hotel rooms have been added in a few short years, including resorts in Summerlin and Lake Las Vegas.",3.5,3.2
The growth that has characterized Las Vegas for nearly a century may be facing a roadblock.,2.56,2.78
"Still, the future of Las Vegas is sure to be determined as much by the pioneering spirit that built the city as by anything else.",3.3,2.8
"With its new look and new aim, the prospects are good despite the warnings.",3.6,3.2
"Mysteriously, the Anasazi vanished from the valley around a.d. 1150, leaving it to be repopulated by the Southern Paiutes, another hunter-gatherer tribe.",3.0,2.5
"Inevitably, some people will get burned in the process, but others will rise triumphantly from the fray to even greater successes.",3.38,3.25
"And that, more than anything, is the one constant that characterizes the past, present, and future of Las Vegas.",3.0,2.89
"Unable to replicate the agricultural techniques of the Anasazi, the Paiutes were destined to a semi-nomadic lifestyle until European settlers arrived, changing the nature of existence in the valley forever.",3.0,3.0

"In the early nineteenth century, America’s western territories were still largely unexplored.",3.11,3.0
"It was not until 1829 that Rafael Rivera, a Mexican scout, found a spring-fed valley and dubbed it Las Vegas — a Spanish name that leaves many modern visitors wondering exactly where “the meadows” really lay.",3.2,2.9
"For fifteen years, Las Vegas was used as a Spanish Trail way-station.",3.0,3.0

A Brief History,3.0,2.57
This put Las Vegas on the map and was one of the crucial turning points of its history.,3.0,2.8
"In 1855, Mormon leader Brigham Young responded to promising reports of Las Vegas by sending 30 missionary settlers to the valley; they eventually built a fort not far from today’s Downtown.",3.0,3.0
"Surrounded by acres of farmland hewn from the hard desert, the adobe fort became a focal point for the development of Las Vegas for the next fifty years.",3.0,2.8
The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries.,2.9,3.0
"The missionaries struggled valiantly against the dictates of the desert, trying simultaneously to survive the harshness of their circumstances and spread the Mormon faith.",2.7,3.4
Additional pressures from arriving miners pushed the missionaries’ plight beyond recovery.,2.4,3.1
"Their supplies scarce, their harvest meager, and their spirit broken, they abandoned the fort in 1858.",2.2,3.1
"Despite the fact that the local land was rich in silver, by 1865 most of the mining traffic through Las Vegas was of prospectors headed to California or Northern Nevada in search of gold.",3.1,2.9
One opportunist who stayed was Octavius Decatur Gass.,3.2,3.3
"Bestowed with plenty of the invaluable pioneer spirit that characterizes Las Vegas to this day, Gass redirected his life by picking up where the Mormons left off — at least when it came to ranching and farming.",3.0,2.78
The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated.,3.0,3.0
"Gass took over the abandoned Mormon fort and 640 acres (260 hectares) surrounding it, dubbing it the Las Vegas Ranch.",3.1,3.1
He expanded the ranch and irrigated the land so that it would support crops and cattle.,3.0,3.1
His determination had other results as well: Gass was named a justice of the peace and a territorial legislator.,3.25,3.0
"Despite his ambition, Gass’ success was short-lived.",2.7,2.8
"In the late 1870s, he defaulted on a loan from rancher Archibald Stewart, so Stewart took the Las Vegas Ranch for his own.",2.8,3.0
"True to wild-West stereotypes, Stewart was slain by a neighboring farmer, leaving his strong-willed wife, Helen, to assume the duties of the ranch.",2.75,2.88
Fossils tell an obscure story of man’s slow and sporadic development.,3.0,2.6
"Through 1905, Helen Stewart expanded the ranch to 2000 acres (810 hectares), making quite a bit of money in the process.",3.62,3.25

At the turn of the 19th century Los Angeles and Salt Lake City were among the burgeoning metropolises of the new American West.,3.1,2.9
"Though the two cities remained unlinked by rail, this was about to change quickly.",3.0,3.33
"When it did, the Las Vegas Valley (which at the time had a non-native population of less than 30) would change as well.",2.9,2.9
"Around 3000 b.c. , native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture.",3.18,3.18
"In 1903, officials of the San Pedro, Los Angeles, and Salt Lake Railroad arrived in Las Vegas, eager to secure a right-of-way for their Los Angeles–Salt Lake connection.",3.14,3.0
Las Vegas would serve as a major stopover for crew rest and train repair.,3.12,3.12
"For all this, the railroad needed land.",3.0,2.7
"As mapped, the track traveled directly through Helen Stewart’s Las Vegas Ranch.",3.14,2.86
Stewart sold 99.5 percent of her ranch to the railroad.,3.2,2.9
The remainder she returned to the native Paiutes.,3.11,3.0
"In early 1905, the route between Los Angeles and Salt Lake City was completed, and train tracks bore right down the center of the Las Vegas Valley.",3.2,2.7
"On 15 May 1905, the railroad held a land sale — a momentous step in Las Vegas history.",3.5,3.1
"Standing at the depot at Main and Fremont streets, railroad officials auctioned 1200 lots they had subdivided from forty square blocks of desert scrub.",3.0,2.67
"By this time, the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today, with one exception — the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas.",3.0,3.1
Las Vegas was no longer a small pioneer settlement.,3.0,2.78
"With rail service in place and forty blocks of private property, it was ready to become a real town.",3.2,2.5
"Businesses sprang up overnight, and wooden houses were erected to replace the tent city in which many of the early settlers had lived.",3.1,3.1
"One year after the auction, the population of Las Vegas had ballooned to 1500 residents, a portent of things to come for the next ninety years.",3.12,3.12
Dam Good Luck,3.5,3.0
"From the beginning, Las Vegas was built to serve travelers.",3.0,2.78
"The railroad needed a way station, and Las Vegas was the place.",3.2,3.0
"Growth continued for ten years, and by 1915 the town had telephones, round-the-clock electricity, and a growing population — many of whom worked in the railroad repair shop.",3.29,3.0
"The inhabited history of the Las Vegas Valley stretches to 23,000 b.c. , when much of the area was covered by a prehistoric lake.",3.0,3.0
But such heady progress would soon come to a halt.,2.88,2.63
"Union Pacific then consolidated its operations, eliminating the Las Vegas repair facility.",2.89,3.0
"Additionally, Las Vegas had been made a part of Nevada’s new Clark County in 1909, a year when the legislature also outlawed gambling.",3.0,3.0
These unfortunate circumstances threatened to relegate Las Vegas to the status of a small desert community that could no longer support its 3000 residents.,2.44,2.67
"But the southwest’s growing need for water, combined with Las Vegas’s fortuitous proximity to the Colorado River, would give Las Vegas a second chance to achieve prosperity.",3.22,3.22
"Construction on Hoover Dam (originally Boulder Dam, subsequently renamed for the president who authorized the project) began in 1931 in a canyon 45 miles (72 km) southeast of Las Vegas.",3.0,2.9
"Providing an influx of $165 million to the southwestern economy, Hoover Dam played a major role in preventing Las Vegas from drying up, both financially and literally.",3.0,2.75
These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River.,3.0,2.67
"Not only did it create jobs, but it also created Lake Mead, the massive reservoir that today provides water to all of southern Nevada.",3.5,3.33
More Government Help,3.12,3.12
"The construction of Hoover Dam did not single-handedly save Las Vegas, however.",2.88,2.75
"The state legislature helped as well, by legalizing gambling in 1931 and thus solidifying the future of the town, though legislators and residents could never have known this at the time.",3.1,3.1
They went to work on what has become one of the lengthiest citywide tourism campaigns ever attempted.,3.0,2.9
It didn’t take long for the city to establish itself as a wild-West town with an “anything goes” attitude.,2.9,3.2
"Vices outlawed or heavily controlled elsewhere were legal here, available any hour of any day (or night).",3.0,3.2
"Strangely enough, the study also included pairs of biological brothers that were not twins, and out of the 142 homosexual males studied, only 14, or about 9 %, had homosexual brothers, which is approximately the normal statistical incidence of homosexuality in the general population (Bailey & Pillard).",3.0,2.8

"Rather, the only actual choice is whether or not to be open with one’s sexuality and sexual preference; whether to act on one’s sexual desires, whether to tell others about such feelings, or whether to live a whole life as a lie and suppress these attractions (Marcus 9).",3.1,2.8
"This shows that not only did Plato consider it normal for a male to be attracted to another male, he also believed that it began at a very young age, as the word “boyhood” signifies.",3.0,2.9
"To supplement my findings from research, I have conducted personal interviews with two adolescent homosexual males, James Dobbens and Daniel Woods.",3.0,2.86

"Both believed that homosexual was a result of nature, rather than nurture (Dobbens & Woods).",2.9,2.8

"He went on to explain that while his nurture did not impact his sexual orientation, it did affect his view of it.",3.0,3.0
"When discussing the role of parents and upbringing in a child’s sexuality, he commented “They can bring you up [to be] open minded to [homosexuality], but they don’t bring you up [to be a homosexual]… I grew up in a place where [homosexuality is accepted], so that’s why I’m so open about being gay; I accept myself… [Whether or not you accept homosexuality and can be honest with yourself if you are homosexual] depends on how you’re brought up” (Dobbens).",3.0,3.0

"Woods generally agreed with Dobbens, and justified his belief that homosexuality was caused by one’s nature, rather than nurture, when he commented that “there’s nothing in my upbringing that exposed me to anything like [homosexuality]” (Woods).",2.9,2.8
“boyhood”,3.0,3.0
"In fact, Plato even considered love between two members of the same sex to be the only “real and lasting love” and necessary for democracy.",3.0,3.0
"When asked why he was gay, he explained that it is simply “something that I can’t help… embedded in my head; nothing made me do it” (Woods).",3.0,3.2
"He went on to explain that it the same thing as the primitive attraction between males and females, only it was between males and other males.",2.9,3.0
He added that “nothing happened [to make me homosexual]; it’s always been there.,3.0,3.0
“nothing happened [to make me homosexual]; it’s always been there. I’ve always been attracted to guys”,3.12,3.12
I’ve always been attracted to guys” (Woods).,3.18,2.82
"What I find to be extraordinary about Woods’ case is that he remarked how while he has always been sexually attracted go guys, he is romantically attracted to women in the sense that he has always wanted a girlfriend and to be close with other females, etc… but never in a sexual sense.",3.0,3.1
"Though he has “always kind of fantasized about getting married [to a female],” these feelings come from his “romantic side, which is different from the sexual side” (Woods).",3.22,3.56
"“always kind of fantasized about getting married [to a female],”",3.3,3.4
"What, exactly, causes homosexuality?",3.0,3.1
"He says that if he married a female with which he shared a strong trust, maybe he could work it out.",3.1,3.0
“real and lasting love”,4.12,3.5
"“It’s like race. It’s all something you can’t help; it all comes to you… It’s internal, you can’t help it”",2.7,3.1
"It’s all something you can’t help; it all comes to you… It’s internal, you can’t help it” (Woods).",2.9,3.0
"When asked if he thought homosexuality was caused by a gene, he commented that he thought that it was more of an instinct.",2.9,2.7
"He gave the example of birds, which are born with instincts such as knowing how to build a next, or catch their prey.",3.0,2.75
Woods also thought that maybe it was caused by something in the development of the embryo.,2.88,3.0
"Furthermore, there were many occurrences of homosexual behavior in Greek mythology; Hercules is rumored to have had 14 male lovers, and Zeus himself partook in such behavior.",3.2,3.1
"All in all, Woods views homosexuality as “fascinating.”",3.0,2.9
“fascinating.”,3.8,3.5
His final thought: “I also believe everyone has at least one homosexual attraction.,3.0,3.0
“I also believe everyone has at least one homosexual attraction. It’s not black and white [homosexual vs. heterosexual]; it’s a spectrum”,3.0,2.8
It’s not black and white [homosexual vs. heterosexual]; it’s a spectrum” (Woods).,3.1,2.9
Yet there are arguments against homosexuality as caused by genetics.,2.9,3.1
"According to Darwin’s theory of natural selection, the advantageous traits are passed on, while the disadvantageous ones eventually die out.",3.0,2.9
"For instance, heterosexual males have an average of five times as many children as homosexual ones, as a female is required to reproduce children, yet homosexuals are, by definition, not sexually attracted to females.",3.0,2.8
"Therefore, from the evolutionary standpoint, homosexuality becomes one of the disadvantageous traits.",3.0,3.0
"Because consequently heterosexual men contribute five times as much genetic information to the next the gene pool, if homosexuality was indeed caused by a gene, it would have died out entirely by now, or at least been reduced immensely in the number of occurrences.",3.1,3.1
"Since neither of these events have yet taken place, it can be concluded that homosexuality is not caused by a gene (Fulkerson).",3.0,2.5
My findings throughout my research have led me to conclude that there is no definitive answer on what causes homosexuality.,3.0,2.9
"No one knows for sure now (although many think they do), and perhaps no one ever will know the whole truth.",2.33,3.0
"Nonetheless, I am apt to believe that homosexuality is the product of some kind of combination of genetic and environmental causes.",3.0,3.0
Perhaps one may have a genetic predisposition towards homosexuality that has been passed on from previous generations.,2.9,3.1
However this does not necessarily determine a homosexual; rather this predisposition must be triggered by environmental factors.,3.0,3.0
"Even Homer wrote about Achilles and Patroclus, who have been considered to be the perfect model of true love (Emond).",3.25,3.13
"This is why Bailey and Pillard found in their study that while they was a greatly elevated chance that two males sharing the same genetic makeup would also share the same sexuality, this was not the case 100 % of the time.",2.88,3.0
"This seems to be the most likely explanation as of now, but even as I write this, new studies are being done.",3.0,2.9
Perhaps the truth is right around the corner.,2.9,2.9

"But it was not until 1869 that the term “homosexual” was first used, to describe “a man or woman whose feelings of sexual attraction are for someone of the same sex” (Marcus 1).",3.0,3.1
“a man or woman whose feelings of sexual attraction are for someone of the same sex”,3.1,2.8

"At this point in time, Karl Maria Kertbeny used the word in a pamphlet which fought to repeal the current antihomosexual laws of Prussia.",2.9,2.7
"Kertbeny derived this word from the Greek word for “same” and the Latin word for “sex,” whereas a heterosexual is a person” whose feelings of sexual attraction are for the opposite sex” (Marcus 1).",3.0,3.0
“same”,3.0,2.9
"“sex,”",3.5,3.7
” whose feelings of sexual attraction are for the opposite sex”,3.0,3.1
Others would argue that it is a result of a child’s upbringing.,2.75,3.0
"It was also in the 1800s when the debate itself over the cause of homosexuality was started by Magnus Hirschfeld, a physician, sex researcher, leading sexologist, homosexual, and founder of the first gay rights movement in Germany, who believed that homosexuality was biological in nature (Marcus 10).",3.09,3.0
"Hirschfeld also founded the Scientific Humanitarian committee, which was mostly homosexual, in 1897.",3.0,2.8
"The committee published many books and other forms of literature, which gave Hirschfeld a great amount of prestige in his field.",3.09,2.91
"He became known as one of the founding fathers of sexology, and furthered this position when he opened the world’s first sexological institute, the institute for Sexual Science in Berlin, in 1919, which was destroyed by the Nazis 15 years later.",2.9,3.2
Still more would claim that it is a mental illness that can and should be cured.,2.9,2.8
The debate over homosexuality has been one of the most long-lasting and controversial ones ever.,2.9,3.1
"Hirschfeld largely supported the Urning theory of Karl Ulrichs, with minor additions; he believed in some hormonal theories as a cause of homosexuality, but this only led to unsuccessful attempts to “cure” homosexuals with the use of hormone injections.",2.7,3.0
"This theory, which defined Urnings as males who turned to other males as sexual partners, was published in twelve pamphlets by Ulrichs, starting in1864.",2.83,3.0
"The first, Vindex, defended Urnings, while the second, Inclusa, which followed shortly after, described the first scientific theory of homoerotic desire.",3.0,2.75
"“hermaphrodites of the mind,”",2.9,3.1
"Perhaps then, it is a combination of some of these?",3.1,2.9
"This, he claimed, made laws such as paragraph 175, a law adopted by King William I throughout the German Kingdoms at the time of their unification which forbade sex between males, and forced criminal penalties upon individuals partaking in such behavior, unfair and unreasonable .",2.9,3.0
"No one knows for sure, and it is possible no one ever will, but that surely does not stop everyone from coming up with their own theories and beliefs on the matter.",2.78,3.22
"A couple thousand years after Plato and Homer, Sigmund Freud still believed homosexuality to be a natural behavior.",2.9,3.1
"In an interview in 1903, he professed his beliefs: “I am… of the firm conviction that homosexuals must not be treated as sick people… Homosexual persons are not sick.",2.67,3.33
“I am… of the firm conviction that homosexuals must not be treated as sick people… Homosexual persons are not sick. They also do not belong in a court of law!”,2.87,3.5
They also do not belong in a court of law!”,2.18,4.0
"In 1935, he furthered his claims when he wrote a now famous “Letter to an American Mother” of a homosexual, which stated that “Homosexuality is assuredly no advantage, but is nothing to be ashamed of, no vice, no degradation, it cannot be classified as an illness… Many highly respectable individuals of ancient and modern times have been homosexuals” (qtd. in Isay 3).",3.0,3.1
“Letter to an American Mother”,3.2,3.2
"“Homosexuality is assuredly no advantage, but is nothing to be ashamed of, no vice, no degradation, it cannot be classified as an illness… Many highly respectable individuals of ancient and modern times have been homosexuals”",3.2,3.0
"However, the general public of the 1800s and early 1900s, including the medical professionals, regarded homosexuality as a curable mental illness.",2.8,3.2
"Treatments such as castration, hysterectomy, lobotomy, and electroshock therapy were used as attempted cures.",2.8,3.0
"By the mid 1900s, psychotherapy became the most common “cure,” and many homosexuals spent countless hours being analyzed in hopes of changing their sexual preference (Dudley 125).",2.62,3.0
"Dr. Evelyn Hooker, a heterosexual psychologist, conducted a ground-breaking study in the mid 1950s that went along similar reasoning as Freud.",3.22,3.11
"In this courageous experiment, Hooker compared the psychological profiles of sixty men, half homosexual and half heterosexual.",3.0,3.2
"She disagreed with the popular belief at the time that homosexuality was a mental illness, and concluded that there was no significant psychological difference between homosexual and heterosexual men; “gay” men were no more insane than their “straight” counterparts (Marcus 183).",2.8,2.8
“gay”,2.5,3.38
"Documented homosexuality dates as far back as ancient Greece and other cultures of the time, where it was considered to be a very normal and natural occurrence (Emond).",3.2,3.2
"Fortunately, many prominent psychiatrists also believed that homosexuality was not an illness, and their lobbying, along with the innovative study performed by Hooker, who has been referred to as “the Rosa Parks of the gay movement” convinced the American Psychiatric Association Board of Trustees to vote to remove homosexuality from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual as a mental illness in December of 1973.",3.0,3.2
“the Rosa Parks of the gay movement”,3.0,2.88
"Just over a year later, the American Psychological Association also removed homosexuality from their list of mental illnesses (Marcus 11).",3.44,3.44
"The American Psychological Association further reiterated this belief when an overwhelming majority of the Council of Representatives adopted the Resolution on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation in 1997, which publicly chastised those who attempted to “cure” homosexuality by means of various forms of treatment.",3.0,3.1
“cure”,3.6,3.2
"It stated, rather that homosexuality was merely a difference in the opinion and values of the common person, but must still be respected as an individual orientation, and thus treated as one (Resolution on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation).",3.1,2.8
"Perhaps one of the most famous studies on this topic was concluded in 1991 by Michael Bailey, an assistant professor of psychology at Northwestern University, and Richard Pillard, an associate professor of psychiatry at Boston University School of Medicine, and found that sexual orientation in males is largely due to genetics.",3.0,3.0
"For two years, these men studied the number of occurrences of homosexuality in both monozygotic, or identical twins (a set of twins coming from the same fertilized egg and thus having identical DNA), and dizygotic, or fraternal twins (a set of twins from too separate zygotes, causing them to have similar DNA, but not any more so than that of two ordinary siblings), in addition to adoptive brothers of gay males (meaning that all of these males would have been raised in the same environment).",3.0,3.0
"In his book The Symposium, Plato wrote “Those who are halves of a man whole pursue males, and being slices, so to speak, of the male, love men throughout their boyhood, and take pleasure in physical contact with men” (qtd. in Isay 11).",3.0,2.9
"In total, 110 pairs of twins (identical and fraternal) and 142 sets of male and their adopted brothers were studied, where at least one of the two had been classified as homosexual, either by self-identification or other means.",3.0,3.0
"“Those who are halves of a man whole pursue males, and being slices, so to speak, of the male, love men throughout their boyhood, and take pleasure in physical contact with men”",3.09,3.18
"Out of the 56 homosexual males who had identical twins, 29, or approximately 52 % of their identical twin brothers were also found to be homosexual, as compared to only 12, or approximately 22 % of the 54 non-identical twins of homosexual males, and 6, or approximately 11 % of the 57 adopted brothers of homosexual males who were unrelated in terms of genetics.",3.0,2.78

"In fact, as I recall, they got over 1 million Facebook fans.",3.3,3.0
Google TGI Friday's Fan Woody and it looks pretty good.,3.5,3.4
But then something not so awesome happened.,2.1,3.1
All those fans wanted their free burgers and they wanted them now!,2.89,3.44
TGI Friday's completely lost control of the page and eventually doled out a lot of free burgers.,2.9,3.4
Now from a short term perspective I'm sure they did ok on the deal.,3.0,2.88
People came in and ate their food.,3.2,3.0
"But they could have accomplished that with coupons in the mail, the newspaper or by an email list.",3.0,2.9

"Oh, the numbers look good, but when you dig a little deeper a different picture emerges.",3.0,2.9
"Apparently Woody and his 900,000+ fans went poof .",2.7,2.9
How come?,2.86,3.14
I'm guessing it had something to do with the venom and general anarchy the page had created by buying fans rather than growing them.,2.9,2.9
"A TGI Friday's Facebook page does exist, with roughly a third of the fans they used to have.",3.0,3.0
"TGI Friday's pretty much had to spray Agent Orange on their relationship with 600,000 people.",2.4,3.3
I think plenty of brands have heard the siren call of Facebook ads.,2.88,3.25
"The ability to target your demo is really terrific, but you're in danger of creating a relationship with fans that ultimately is built on a ""what have you done for me lately"" foundation.",2.71,3.0
"First, you essentially bought these fans.",2.83,2.83
You paid Facebook for the right to target them.,2.89,3.22
"Walls filled with off topic conversations at best, vile language and real antipathy for the brand at worst.",2.57,3.29
"Then in the case of TGI Friday's or other brands that offer free product or discount coupons, you are essentially buying them again.",2.89,3.33
"This sets up a pattern where the consumer now expects to be rewarded for being your fan with a tangible item, that is, free stuff.",2.9,3.1
"That's not a bonus item, it's now a standard part of the agreement.",3.18,3.0
Want me as a fan?,3.2,3.4
Give me free stuff.,3.2,3.3
"The point of Social Media isn't to distribute coupons and a real fan wants to engage with a brand for a whole host of reasons, often free / discounted product is the least of these reasons.",3.11,3.11
"I'm not saying that special bonuses, or 'surprise and delight' offers aren't ever a good thing.",2.91,2.91
I think when used properly they can be terrific.,3.1,2.9

"The universities attract students from all over the world, and this influx helps to make Dublin a busy, buzzing international city.",3.44,3.22
"However, young and old, stranger and Dubliner rub shoulders quite happily.",3.78,3.44
Religion and respect for parents has not yet gone out of fashion.,3.2,3.1

Unemployment is at an all-time low.,3.5,3.2

"But in fact, once news of the handover vanished from the front pages, the people of Hong Kong returned to their usual topics of conversation: the economy and the price of housing.",2.9,2.1
With its vibrant atmosphere and night-and-day activity it is an intoxicating place.,3.6,3.5
The impression of the visitor today will be that very little has changed.,3.0,2.9
"Establishments are no longer called “Royal,” Queen Elizabeth has vanished from the coinage, and the Union Jack has been replaced by the flag of China and the new Hong Kong flag with its bauhinia flower.",2.9,3.1

Others are more subtle.,3.1,2.9
British social customs are still evident in the kind of polite service you get in hotels and in the long lines of people waiting for buses at rush hour.,3.1,2.7

"And the first person he chose to join him was Karnes, though he couldn't reveal the mission to Karnes.",3.0,3.0
"Karnes, 87, is a retired history professor who lives in suburban Austin with his wife, Virginia, who also worked for the 509th as a civilian bookkeeper for six months.",3.0,3.0
"Karnes was Tibbets' adjutant, the man in charge of writing the orders and cajoling the transfer to the unit of servicemen proficient in bombing, mechanics, ordnance, engineering and communications.",3.0,2.86
Tibbets hated paperwork.,2.5,2.8
Karnes thought it was a breeze.,3.12,2.88
They were a wartime match that changed the world.,3.0,3.33
"Japan surrendered within days of the detonation of the atomic bombs that killed 140,000 people in Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945, and 70,000 in Nagasaki three days later.",2.64,3.18
"AUSTIN, Texas -- Tom Karnes was dialing for destiny, but not everyone wanted to cooperate.",2.9,2.8
"The story of the 509th is a tale of an elite outfit that lived in a bubble of secrecy and endured the taunts of other war-weary U.S. units that resented sharing a small Pacific island with the 509th, which appeared exempt from combat.",2.88,2.88
Tinian Island was the staging area where the 509th moved after its creation in the desert.,2.89,2.56
Karnes has never spoken publicly about his role as Tibbets' right-hand administrative aide.,3.0,2.9
He never even told his story to students in his 40 years of teaching college.,2.9,2.9
"War is hell, he says, and when it was over, he wanted to come home and rejoin his young family and not dwell on it.",2.8,3.1
He earned a doctorate in history from Stanford University and taught Latin American history at Tulane University and Arizona State University.,3.0,3.14
Next week marks the 57th anniversary of the atomic bombings.,2.9,2.8
"Karnes sat in his wood-paneled office in a Quonset hut in the middle of the Great Salt Lake Desert, a black telephone to his ear.",2.8,3.1
"Each year on Aug. 6, ""I always think of Paul Tibbets and how he handled unbelievable responsibility,"" Karnes said.",3.12,3.0
Karnes met Tibbets when the 29-year-old bomber pilot walked into Karnes' office at Wendover Army Air Field on the Utah-Nevada border.,3.0,3.1
Karnes was the personnel and classification officer.,3.0,2.7
"He was only a captain, but he had been left in charge at Wendover the day Tibbets surprised them by landing a B-29, a new plane no one at Wendover had seen.",3.12,2.75
Tibbets had just been ordered to organize a combat force to drop a bomb being developed by a secret enterprise known as the Manhattan Project.,2.8,3.2
He was searching for a remote installation to train bomber crews and support units in total secrecy.,2.9,2.9
Tibbets instantly liked the isolation and vast size of Wendover and the surrounding Bonneville Salt Flats.,3.3,3.3
"And he immediately liked Karnes, who showed him around the base.",3.5,3.2
"In Karnes, Tibbets found a kindred spirit -- and a handball partner.",3.1,3.0
"Both were smart, disciplined, quiet men who thrived on efficiency, perfection and self-reliance.",3.0,2.9
Each had skills the other admired.,3.1,3.2
"Tibbets was a decorated, top-gun pilot, but Karnes could wrangle the military rule book as well as Tibbets could fly.",2.8,2.8
He was tracking down men to join a group so secret he couldn't admit it existed.,2.82,3.09
"""I don't recall ever having to tell Tom to do anything,""",2.6,2.8
"""I don't recall ever having to tell Tom to do anything,"" Tibbets said in an e-mail this week.",2.8,3.1
"""He was so knowledgeable he just got things done, allowing me to concentrate on other matters.",3.33,3.11
I was very lucky to have Tom.,3.6,3.6
"""",3.0,2.78
Tibbets quickly returned to Wendover after that first visit to set up his headquarters.,3.09,2.73
His first order appointed Karnes adjutant for the 509th.,2.9,2.9
"Almost overnight, Wendover became a high-security base filled with off-limit areas covered in barbed wire.",3.0,2.83
"No one was allowed to talk about what they saw or heard, even though most of the 509th had no idea why they were there, except that 15 B-29s were being modified to carry a heavy load.",2.5,3.12
Karnes and his staff read outgoing mail to make sure no secrets slipped out.,2.73,3.09
"Karnes hated to pry, and skimmed over personal portions of the letters.",2.8,2.9
On his metal desk were names of military men being ordered into the organization.,3.0,3.1
Phone calls were monitored.,2.44,3.33
An undercover force of Manhattan Project security agents infiltrated the base and bars in the little town of Wendover (population 103) to spy on airmen.,2.64,3.09
"Karnes knew the 509th was preparing for a special bombing mission, but he had no idea what kind of bombs were involved.",2.73,3.0
"""I had a friend, the finance officer.",3.1,2.9
"He said that they had split the atom and that we were going to drop an atomic bomb,""",2.78,3.22
"He said that they had split the atom and that we were going to drop an atomic bomb,"" Karnes said.",2.75,2.88
"""I said, `No.""'",2.2,3.5
"A noncommittal ""mmm-mm,"" was the most Karnes could ever get out of Tibbets on matters of the bomb.",2.78,2.89
"""mmm-mm,""",3.3,3.2
"By spring, the 509th prepared to move to Tinian Island, near Guam and Saipan.",3.0,2.6
"That would put the B-29s about 1,500 miles from Japan -- a 13-hour round-trip flight.",2.9,3.0
"Karnes was deluged with orders for inoculations, equipment, transfers and promotions.",2.9,3.1
He was calling bases all over the United States to line up their transfer to the desert outside Salt Lake City.,3.0,2.82
"Karnes arrived on Tinian on May 18, 1945, as part of an advance team that flew in the five C-54 transport planes of the 509th.",3.0,2.78
"On May 29, 1,200 men arrived on the troopship Cape Victory after a five-week trip from Seattle.",3.09,2.82
"Tinian Island had been captured from Japan, and the Seabees, the construction arm of the Navy, had built two large airfields.",3.0,3.2
The 509th took North Field and stayed in relative isolation from other B-29 units on the island.,3.0,3.1
"Karnes handed out bunk assignments, choosing the mess officer, Chuck Perry, to share his tent.",3.0,3.0
"Karnes had his own Jeep, and went to the beach and to evening movies shown by other units as often as he could.",3.18,2.91
Not until the day before Tibbets and his crew flew to Hiroshima was the 509th told what was happening.,2.8,2.8
"The word spread: ""This is it.",3.0,2.71
"""This is it.",3.0,3.5
"This is the big mission.""",3.09,3.18
"Karnes and hundreds of other men from the 509th stood along the flight line as Tibbets and the Enola Gay took off at 2:45 a.m. on Aug. 6, a warm, tropical night.",3.0,3.0
"""Where is the authority?""",2.8,3.0
Three B-29s had gone ahead to check the weather at Hiroshima and two other possible bomb sites.,3.0,3.17
Two other B-29s left in two-minute intervals after Tibbets so their crews could take photos and drop devices to measure radiation and other effects of the bomb.,2.86,3.0
Tibbets got the word only an hour from Hiroshima that the city's weather was clear.,3.1,2.7
"As they approached, Tibbets braced for Japanese anti-aircraft fire.",2.78,3.44
None came.,2.7,2.8
"Early in the flight, the crew had inserted a plug of uranium into the 9,000-pound bomb, nicknamed ""Little Boy.",2.5,3.5
"""",3.0,2.6
"Ninety seconds from the bomb drop, Tibbets put the plane on auto-pilot.",2.8,3.3
The crew slipped on dark glasses to prepare for the blinding flash of the bomb.,2.7,3.2
"At 8:15 a.m. Hiroshima time, the pneumatic bomb-bay doors opened and ""Little Boy,"" equivalent to 20,000 tons of TNT, fell out.",2.0,3.5
"The Enola Gay climbed, and Tibbets fought to turn the plane in the air-bending, 155-degree the crews had been practicing off Tinian for months.",3.0,2.9
He pushed off the dark glasses because he couldn't see to fly.,3.0,2.9
"""Who says this?""",3.0,3.3
"""Who says this?"" another commanding officer asked Karnes.",3.0,2.86
"When the bomb exploded as planned 1,890 feet over Hiroshima, Tibbets' mouth tingled, and he tasted the lead fillings in his teeth.",2.7,3.3
"A minute later, the shock wave hit.",2.6,3.5
The crew was horrified by the purple mushroom cloud that climbed to 10 miles and looked as if it would engulf the Enola Gay.,2.3,3.6
"More shocking was the city of Hiroshima, which was on fire and bubbling like tar.",2.5,3.2
"""We were all appalled,""",2.2,3.5
"Back on Tinian, Karnes had gone to bed.",2.9,2.8
But he didn't sleep long.,2.44,2.78
"Someone woke him to say Gen. Hap Arnold, chief of the Army Air Forcesin Washington, was on the phone and asking for him.",3.0,3.0
"Each time, Karnes said what he had to: ""Call Air Force headquarters if you don't believe me.""",2.9,3.2
"Arnold told Karnes, ""Tibbets is going to be landing in three to four hours, and I want to give him the Distinguished Service Cross, and it is your job to write up the explanation.""",3.1,3.0

"When an unsuspecting Tibbets descended from the Enola Gay on Tinian, he barely managed to palm his pipe as Gen. Carl Spaatz, commander of the Strategic Air Forces, stepped forward to pin the medal on his bomb flight coveralls.",3.12,2.88
"Karnes, like the hundreds of others gathered along the flight line, was jubilant.",3.5,3.25
He knew the war would soon be over and he would be heading home.,3.33,3.11
A yearof secrecy and hard work wasover.,3.0,2.86
"Three days later, another B-29 from the 509th bombed Nagasaki.",2.33,3.0
"Five days later, Japan surrendered and World War II was over.",3.3,3.2
"Today, Karnes is frustrated that some of his fellow historians, the ones he calls ""revisionists,"" question the wisdom and morality of the bombings.",2.5,3.1
“I will help you find your Rachel.,3.1,3.3

I’ve never had to give this conversation before.,2.78,3.22
"Come on, I have something to show you.”",3.1,3.2
"With that, he made a sharp turn onto a side street that I hadn’t noticed before.",2.9,3.0
We drove between slummy housing and storefronts so decayed that I couldn’t tell whether they were abandoned.,2.33,3.0
My driver turned again next to an old warehouse that I might have been in once when Mitch took us to a rave in sophomore year.,3.0,3.0
"In front of a few houses, there were cars parked, but there were almost none on the streets.",2.9,2.7
"Their bumpers looked ready to drop off, and their paint was half smog.",2.78,2.89
I got a strange feeling that we weren’t supposed to be driving here.,2.43,3.29

"“Hey,” I said, “are you sure that we should be going this way?",2.78,3.0

"“Just ignore that,” he told me.",2.71,2.43
“You’ll be used to the sensation in a moment.”,3.12,3.12
That just unnerved me more.,2.0,3.8
"As we kept driving, the anxiety grew more pronounced.",2.6,3.4
My girlfriend Rachel and I would go to the clubs near our school.,3.25,3.12
"I noticed that there were some people on the street, people the same color as the soiled buildings.",2.75,3.0
Someone standing just in the lip of an alley glared at me with gleaming eyes.,2.64,3.18
He parked and got out.,2.9,2.8
“Is it really safe to leave the car …”,2.6,3.1
"he was already walking toward the squat, brick-windowed building we were parked next to.",3.0,3.1

"I hopped out, ran after him, and reached him just as he was knocking on the door.",3.0,3.3
"Someone opened it a crack, then ushered us in.",2.8,3.1
"Sometimes we'd get word that people were gathering under one of the bridges, and we'd rush down to hit it before the cops broke it up.",3.2,3.4
"Inside, the building opened up.",2.91,2.73
"The ceiling was high and wooden, and I could see part of a DJ’s booth down the hall.",3.2,2.9
It looked like we were in the back of a nightclub.,3.0,2.8
Then I looked down and saw what had let us in.,3.0,2.9
What up?”,3.11,3.11
The hunchbacked being who let us in held out a scraggly paw for him to slap.,2.75,3.0
"“Nice, my man,”",3.9,3.3
"“Nice, my man,” he said as they clasped hands.",3.73,3.09
“Who’s the freak?”,2.22,3.33
“This is someone from Ivan’s family.,3.11,2.89
Did I ever tell you about them?”,3.0,2.83
"“Yeah, one time, man, but you were pretty fucked up.",2.4,3.3
"What’s your problem, kid?”",2.4,3.5
The hunchbacked man came up to my stomach.,2.8,2.9
"His skin was brown and stretched, like some diseased sapling’s bark.",2.56,2.78
"It pulled back around his fingertips, which bore things that might have been nails or claws.",2.62,3.38
"When he grinned, I saw that his teeth were sharp and small, like a hunting cat’s.",2.86,3.0
"Under matted hair, his eyes had slit pupils.",2.9,2.9
Nepthys quickly answered for me.,3.0,2.57
“Girlfriend troubles.,2.3,2.9
"She came down here with someone after a party, and I don’t think it was one of your average pixies.”",2.9,3.1
“Bummer.,1.9,3.1
"So, what’s the cat look like?”",3.3,3.0
He turned to me.,3.0,2.75
"Nepthys nodded: “It’s okay, you can trust him.",3.1,2.9
"“It’s okay, you can trust him.",3.2,3.2
That’s why we came here.”,3.2,3.1
It was easier to talk than to question.,2.9,2.9
“I …I noticed him from across the room when I was looking around for Rachel.,2.9,3.3
Boston is a strange place at night.,2.7,2.9
"He was standing right in front of some blue lights, so I couldn’t see him very well, but I noticed the way that the light set off his pale skin.",3.2,3.0
It almost looked like the light bent around him without actually touching him directly.,3.2,3.1
"He was slim, almost drawn, but he had a kind of … luster to him, I guess.",3.1,3.0
"He wasn’t a person you’d describe with normal adjectives, you know?”",2.9,3.0
"You wouldn't believe half of the shit I've seen, even when I was straight.",2.7,3.4
They nodded.,3.0,2.8
"“Oh, totally,”",3.12,3.0
"“Oh, totally,” said the hunchback.",2.9,2.9
“I get that all the time around here.”,3.1,3.0
"“He was wearing a sort of jacket …maybe blue velvet, I couldn’t tell in the dark, but it had ruffles at the throat, things like that.",3.0,2.88
He really stood out.,3.12,3.25
That’s why I couldn’t understand why no-one else remembered him.,2.8,3.1
"He had some rings, too.",3.0,2.62
"I remember that he hardly ever moved, just stared at Rachel.",2.8,2.8
"Even when he talked, he hardly opened his mouth.",3.0,2.8
I don’t know how he could’ve been heard over the music.”,2.8,2.9
The two glanced at each other.,3.1,3.0
“What do you think?”,3.0,3.2
asked the hunchback.,3.0,2.55
"“I’ve looked into it a little, and I do think we might be dealing with one of them.",2.6,3.0
Have you seen anyone like that in your club?”,3.0,2.89
"“Not that I can remember, man.",3.0,2.88
"I can send you to a guy who knows all about them, though.",3.0,2.6
It was a Friday night.,3.0,2.7

It won’t be long before nightfall.”,2.8,2.9
"“Oh yeah, man.",3.57,2.86
"Rachel and I went out to dinner, and when we finished, she saw that there was a message on her cell phone.",3.0,3.2
"Here, let me write down how to find him.”",3.0,2.9
"The hunchback pulled out a scrap of paper and scribbled something on it with his fingernail, then handed it to Nepthys.",3.0,2.88
"“Here you go, man.",3.0,2.7
Good luck!”,4.09,3.54
"“Thanks, Dvorov.",3.56,3.0
I owe you one.,3.6,3.1
Let’s go.”,3.3,3.1
That last one was to me.,2.8,2.9
I waved goodbye to the hunchback as we left.,3.11,3.0
"He gave me a half-hearted wave that made me wonder what exactly we were chasing, and whether I should be wearing body armor.",2.9,3.0
"Back on the street, I began to see things that I had never looked for until then.",3.2,3.3
"Still in my initial shock, I suddenly noticed qualities of the people that my mind hadn’t registered when we parked.",2.6,3.2
"I saw people with skin stretched so tightly across their cheekbones that the corners had broken through – people whose cheekbones had horns growing from them, and people whose skin was gathered back like a ponytail.",2.6,3.1
"The yellow of this sky wasn’t just smog: it had a leeching, heavy dimness.",2.25,3.12
I saw men three feet tall with dusty black skin and eyes that shed yellow light.,2.67,3.22
"A corpulent, batrachian woman walked along with something on a leash that looked like a massive water beetle.",2.75,3.0
She checked it there in the restaurant.,3.0,2.88
"Leaning from the rough-hewn window of one building on our right was something with long, green hair draped across the seven gangly arms hanging from its windowsill.",3.0,2.63
Thirty-five thin fingers waved lazily like seaweed.,3.0,2.7
I noticed when my back hit the wall that I was walking backwards.,2.78,2.78
"“We, and thousands like us, have been living separately as long as there has been a human society,”",2.75,3.0
"“We, and thousands like us, have been living separately as long as there has been a human society,” said my driver.",3.0,2.8
"Her head tilted into the phone as she listened, her pleather purse on her lap, shining jet against the worn black of her snug Dead Can Dance T-shirt.",3.0,3.0
I noticed that the wrinkles on his neck expanded as he breathed and realized that they were gills.,2.9,2.9
"“We interact with humans, take advantage of them, grant them boons, sometimes even become their friends, but the majority of both societies have little or no interaction.",2.8,3.0
"At this point, we have removed ourselves so fully from quotidian human existence that we are understood to be fictional.",2.8,3.2
“The only place with any significant interaction between our worlds is on the fringes of yours.,3.0,3.0
"Love-ins, raves, gatherings where society is put on hold and humans open themselves to emotion: that is where entities from this world tend to go when they cross over, and that is where Rachel met someone from this world.",3.2,3.1
"Those of us who live permanently in this world tend to set up in places like this, where the human population is so overwhelming that they won’t be noticed in the right corner, with the right protective spells.”",2.7,3.2
He took out the hunchback’s directions and glanced at an alley behind us.,2.88,2.63
"“Okay, Nathan.",3.0,3.0
We should get started right away.,3.11,3.33
There’s no time to waste.”,3.0,3.2
He saw that I wasn’t moving.,2.66,3.11
"Setting an arm on my shoulder, he said, “Nathan, what you see here might be frightening, but those things you saw are people just like you.",3.0,3.0
They’ll be as surprised to see a human as you are to see men with seven arms.”,3.1,3.1
“Thanks.,3.43,3.29
It’s very reassuring that I’ll not only be an outsider but a curiosity.”,3.2,3.2
"“It’s from Mitch,”",3.11,2.78
"“Nathan, you told me five minutes ago that you would do anything to help Rachel.",2.8,3.2

"In this world, one’s word is a promise.",3.14,2.86
"Now, can we get going?”",2.5,3.4
I caught my breath and forced myself to look him in the eye.,2.9,3.2
"“He says we should meet him tonight, there’s a good one going on in that church that closed down last month.”",3.0,3.0
“Only if you stop beginning every sentence with my name.”,2.75,3.12
“You’ve got a deal.,3.57,3.43
Let’s go.”,3.1,3.1
"As we headed down the sidewalk, I said, “What is your name, anyway?”",3.1,3.1
"“What is your name, anyway?”",3.1,3.0
“That’s a question you learn not to ask here.,2.8,3.1
What you may call me is Nepthys.”,3.0,2.89
"Holding Dvorov’s directions, Nepthys took us around the corner of the building into a skinny alleyway.",3.0,2.9
I started wondering again how reliable my guide’s credentials were.,2.4,3.3
"Walking through an alley with rubbish piles that occasionally skittered from one wall to the other, he did not inspire confidence.",2.2,3.1
"“Just at this corner,”",3.0,2.71
"“Just at this corner,” he said, interrupting my immanent panic attack, “we’re going to stop and turn three times widdersh – er, counterclockwise, then face east.",3.0,3.25
"“we’re going to stop and turn three times widdersh – er, counterclockwise, then face east.",2.8,3.0
East is that way.”,3.0,2.6
He pointed at the wall to our right.,3.0,3.14
“Don’t let the sun fool you.,2.8,3.0
"Then I’m going to shed a little blood, but don’t worry, none of yours.”",3.0,3.43
"I blinked at him, but he just kept walking until we reached the corner.",2.9,2.9
"“Okay, you might feel silly, but just turn three times to your left.",3.0,3.2
Try to keep in time with me.”,2.89,2.67
"We spun around three times, and then something flashed across Nepthys’ hand and he shook a spray of blood onto the dust.",2.6,3.1
“I don’t know … it was going to be just us tonight.,2.6,3.2
"The blood flashed into flames as soon as it hit the ground, and I jumped back.",2.6,3.3
"When it had all burnt, a thin outline of a doorframe appeared on the wall across from our corner.",2.9,2.7
"Nepthys walked towards it and pressed his bloody palm against it, opening the door.",2.78,3.0
“Are you coming?”,3.0,3.0
"We slipped through the door and came out, not inside the building, but on a busy street in a completely different part of town.",3.0,3.0
"The sky, cupping over squat buildings, was less yellow here, and stands were set up everywhere the way I’d picture a market in the Middle East.",3.0,2.87
I’m not sure I’m up for a night out.”,2.5,2.9
"Nepthys took us immediately to the right, where he led us to a cart filled with herbs.",3.0,2.8
"Spiced air hanging around the cart carried tarragon, rosemary, and scents I couldn’t place.",3.1,2.9
The thing tending the cart reminded me of the caterpillar from Alice in Wonderland: it had the same opium-dream wise man quality I’d always given the caterpillar.,3.29,2.86
I was feeling calm and private that night.,3.1,1.8
"Its arms were thin and long enough to reach any herbs from its cushion in the center of the cart, and with its long, many-shouldered pole of a torso, it rose over our heads even while seated.",3.0,3.0
"Its face was small and wrinkled, with penny-sized smoked glasses balanced on its thin nose.",3.0,2.8
“Would the gentlemen care to purchase some fine herbs?”,3.2,3.0
it asked.,3.0,3.0
"“There are no finer to spice a meal, nor purer to mix a potion.",3.11,2.78
"It seemed like tonight’s darkness was small and personal, cupped hands offering a place for two, not the burning, open darkness of a rave.",2.67,3.17
"Please, let yourselves breathe the fine scent of these herbs.”",3.29,3.0
"“We’re not here to browse,”",2.89,3.0
"“We’re not here to browse,” Nepthys told him.",2.67,2.78
“We’d like to see a man about some garlic.”,3.0,2.9
The thing frowned.,2.18,2.91
"“We have many fine cloves of garlic here on the cart, gentle sir.",3.4,3.2
If – ”,2.9,2.8
“You know what I mean.,3.14,3.0
"Please, if we could see him, we would be much obliged.",3.64,3.45
I imagine that people do not come here for unimportant reasons.”,3.1,2.6
It hissed thoughtfully.,2.8,2.8
"“True, true.",3.1,2.7
"Step behind the cart and enter through the door there, using your left hand to open the door and your right – ”",3.0,2.7
he looked at me “ – to close it.”,3.0,3.0
“ – to close it.”,2.9,2.9
“Thank you.”,3.9,3.1
Nepthys bowed slightly and we walked behind the cart.,3.14,3.14
The latch opened under Nepthys’ left hand with a clack!,3.0,3.6
The door took us to the bottom of a flight of wooden stairs.,2.9,2.9
At the top was one door.,3.0,2.62
We entered.,3.0,2.88
"The room held a bed, a bookcase, and a desk with one chair.",2.86,2.86
Its only light came from a dying candle on the desk whose spark etched shadows in the roughly planked walls.,3.0,3.0
"On the bed was a small, ratty man.",2.7,2.8
I smelled matted hair and cedar chips.,2.9,3.1
He opened one eye when we came in but did not move.,2.9,2.8
"“We’re here for information about a vampire,”",3.1,3.2
"“We’re here for information about a vampire,” said Nepthys.",3.0,2.9
"“Oh, shit!”",1.9,4.3
I said.,3.0,2.8
"“Sorry, kid.",2.4,3.0
–Would you do us the kindness of helping us to identify an individual?”,3.0,2.8
"“Wait, Nepthys – you said nothing about vampires.",2.8,3.4
"Frankly, I don’t know if we can even doing anything against a vampire.",2.71,3.0
There’s an entire industry in my world based around how unkillable they are.,2.7,3.1
"Are …look, are they as bad as people in my world think they are?”",2.5,3.0
"It’s been over a week, and I want to dance.",3.56,3.56
“I don’t know.,2.56,2.78
"They’re almost as rare here, and I’ve never heard a reliable story of someone successfully fighting a vampire.”",3.09,3.18
"“Only unsuccessfully, right?”",2.44,2.89
"“No, those people don’t usually leave stories.”",2.87,2.88
"“Oh, thanks, Nepthys, for your confidence-inspiring tales of experience.",3.7,3.4
"So they’re probably worse than we think, okay, that’s great.",2.88,2.88
Now can you tell me what your master plan of attack will be before we go spinning counterclockwise into an Anne Rice novel?”,2.9,3.0
"Let’s go together, you know you’ll have fun once you get into it.”",3.56,3.44
“My plan is that you shut up while we’re trying to conduct business with someone who might be able to tell us what we’re actually going up against.,2.4,3.2
Okay?,2.91,2.82
"Don’t forget, she’s your girlfriend.",3.0,3.1
Now calm down while I talk to this gentleman.,2.9,3.1
I can hear your heartbeat from over here.”,3.37,3.63
"It came in through my mother's blood; my Russian grandmother would always tell me stories, bylichkas, of ancestors with the ""second sight"", stupid mill owners who discovered bags of gold after letting a special fish off their hooks, and dark strangers who used to appear to help or interfere at crucial times.",2.91,3.09
I shut up and tried to breathe.,2.29,3.0
"Nepthys turned back to the little man on the bed, who had not moved.",3.0,2.8
"“Please, accept our apologies.",2.4,2.5
"As you can see, our situation is of personal importance to the young man.",3.09,2.73
Now: may we ask you a few questions about an individual we believe to be a vampire?,2.55,3.55
It would be a great help to us.”,3.44,3.33
"She bit the inside of her bottom lip, looking at me like I was breaking her poor, sweet heart.",2.0,3.5
The little man drew a few loud breaths that died in the wooden room’s tight air.,2.55,2.73
"Finally, in a pinched rasp, he said, “My information is purely for the purposes of a collector.",2.75,3.12
“My information is purely for the purposes of a collector.,3.25,2.88
I do not want to provide help to someone who would do harm.”,2.88,3.12
"“Sir, we simply want to discover whether this individual is, in fact, a vampire.",2.8,3.3
"If there is any boon that you would have us do in return, we would be glad to do it.”",3.54,3.18
"He continued to lie in place, still breathing heavily.",2.7,3.3
I tried to keep myself calm.,2.8,3.1
“I have need of a certain stone that I once possessed.,3.0,3.0
"It would allow me to leave this bed, despite my current illness.",3.2,3.1
"My problem is that it was not made in this realm, but by a human, and only a human may handle it.",2.6,3.2
"If you would fetch me this stone, I would tell you what I can.”",3.0,2.67
"“Of course we will fetch you the stone,”",3.12,3.12
"“Of course we will fetch you the stone,” Nepthys assured him.",3.0,2.9
“You have our thanks.”,3.7,3.2
"Outside, the thing at the herb cart nodded when we mentioned the stone.",2.9,2.9
"When we reached the street, I expected some sort of temple, or a row of antiquaries, or at least a sleazy, black-market relics merchant.",2.8,3.3
"Instead, it looked like we were in the red-light district: women who probably wanted more than our money eyed us from the alleys.",2.91,3.09
Nepthys didn’t need to warn me not to speak to them.,2.7,3.3
"“Okay, Rachel.",3.22,3.11
"He took us to the door of a building like a short pagoda that had a sign hanging over it showing a face with hands uplifted, like a saint under G d’s light, and handcuffed.",3.0,3.1
"Let’s go, you’re probably right.”",3.0,3.1
"Inside, the entrance room was hung with bright silks and scattered with velvet cushions.",3.1,2.9
Sails of obscene orange and a green that insulted springtime hung draped across reds that might have been sensual elsewhere but here were only offensive.,2.6,3.2
"A large woman, similarly decorated, quickly drifted up to us.",3.1,3.2
"“Good evening, gentlemen,”",3.5,3.0
"“Good evening, gentlemen,” she said.",3.63,2.91
“May I invite you to have a cup of tea?”,3.11,3.11
"She grinned and gave me a kiss across the table, her lips soft and firm and sticking just enough that she gave the feeling you were really kissing, not just pressing your face into someone else’s.",3.7,3.6
"“No, thank you,”",2.8,2.6
"“No, thank you,” said Nepthys, “we regret that we cannot take up your kind offer.",2.5,2.9
“we regret that we cannot take up your kind offer. Are you the proprietor of this shop?”,3.0,3.0
Are you the proprietor of this shop?”,3.0,3.1
"“Yes,”",3.4,3.2
"“Yes,” answered the woman.",3.29,3.14
"“I am Madame Entera, at your service.",3.29,2.86
She raised an eyebrow.,2.9,3.0
“Are you?,3.1,2.8
"Well, we don’t get many customers asking about that item.",2.78,2.89
"Please, walk this way.”",3.0,3.1
She led us past the silks and through an arch decorated with pictures of wooden ships and what looked like African tribesmen.,3.0,2.88
"The next room had mosaics of what could have been Rome, with men in simple tunics working in a vineyard on one wall and men in odd, floppy hats on the other.",3.25,2.75
"After this, we went up a flight of stairs and past a row of doors barred on the outside.",3.0,3.1
"“Excuse me,”",2.9,2.7
“but may I ask what is kept in these rooms?”,3.0,3.1
The woman laughed.,3.86,3.0
"“Why, the merchandise, of course,”",3.2,3.0
"“Why, the merchandise, of course,” she said.",3.0,2.9
Nepthys leaned close to my ear.,3.14,3.0
"“This is a slave shop,”",2.37,3.13
"“This is a slave shop,” he explained quietly.",2.12,3.12
"The woman paused before another door, this one not barred but locked.",3.0,3.0
"As she brought out the key, she said, “We deal mostly in fairly mundane trades, but there are a few customers with more unusual needs and people willing to sell unusual items.",3.0,2.88
"“We deal mostly in fairly mundane trades, but there are a few customers with more unusual needs and people willing to sell unusual items.",3.0,2.75
"We’ve had genies, indentured sorcerers, even golems and the occasional elf.",3.22,3.0
"This is one of the stranger items, though.",3.0,3.0
It’s been in our collection for several years because only a human can activate it.,3.0,2.38
"If we only had a human on our staff, we could have done so ages ago and sold it off, but we have no such luck.”",2.57,3.0
She opened the door and took us past several doors marked with odd geometrical designs to another locked room.,3.0,3.0
"“Here it is,”",3.09,3.0
"“Here it is,” she said.",3.0,2.9
"With a flourish, she opened the door to reveal a room with walls inlaid with lapis and gold wire, intricate patterns like a Czar’s jewelry box crawling down the walls.",3.0,3.0
"In its center, under a spearing, white light, was a golden table draped with a blue velvet cloth, on which lay a gray, plum-sized rock.",3.1,3.2
"“Let’s not get fucked up tonight, though, okay, Rache?",2.83,3.17
"“A marvel, isn’t it?”",3.5,3.5
she said.,3.0,3.0
“That such a rock could hold so much magic – it’s a wonder.”,3.67,3.5
"“That it is,”",3.0,2.75
"“That it is,” Nepthys assured her.",3.0,3.0
“What would convince you to part with it?”,3.0,3.22
"“You wouldn’t give me the human, would you?",3.0,2.7
"No,",2.5,2.88
"No,”",2.29,3.43
"she said, seeing his expression, “that would make the stone rather useless.”",2.9,2.9
“that would make the stone rather useless.”,2.75,3.0
"Nevertheless, she gave me what I can only describe as an “appraising glance”.",3.4,3.2
“appraising glance”,3.3,2.9
I have never felt so appraised in all my life.,3.86,3.43
"“He looks healthy,”",3.6,3.0
"“He looks healthy,” she said, “how about a pint of his blood?”",3.0,3.4
“how about a pint of his blood?”,2.75,3.25
We don’t – ”,2.8,3.0
“A pint?,3.0,3.11
"Madame, I have his health to consider.”",2.88,2.75
I have his health to consider.”,2.82,2.82
"“Half a pint, then – and his hair.”",2.9,3.0
Nepthys turned to me.,3.0,3.0
"“Well, kid, what do you think?",2.86,3.14
"Remember, this is your quest.",3.0,2.75
I’m not giving my blood.”,2.2,3.4
"“Sure, babe.",3.14,3.0
"“As if I wanted it,”",2.6,3.4
"“As if I wanted it,” interrupted the woman.",2.44,3.44
"“I think it’s a fair deal, considering the return,”",3.2,3.1
"“I think it’s a fair deal, considering the return,” he told me, “but it’s up to you.”",3.3,2.9
“but it’s up to you.”,3.0,3.0
"Come on, I don’t have to get fucked up every time we go out just to enjoy myself.",2.27,3.64
"I thought about it, then nodded.",3.09,3.09
“Marvelous!” cried the woman.,4.0,3.67
"“One half-pint of human blood, willingly given, and his fine head of hair for the stone.”",2.7,3.0
She took us downstairs to a small room behind a red silk draping.,3.0,3.0
"There was a wooden chair, where she sat me down and asked me to wait.",3.0,2.6
"Soon, she came back with a lidded ceramic bowl, which she put on the table beside me.",3.0,2.75
"“Roll up your sleeves,”",3.0,3.4
"“Roll up your sleeves,” she told me.",3.0,2.9
"She opened the bowl and carefully, gingerly brought out a fat, dripping leech.",3.1,3.3
It must have been larger than my finger.,3.0,2.9
She laid it gently inside the hollow of my left arm.,3.2,3.1
"The cold thing stretched and cast around with its sucker-mouth until it found the soft spot inside my elbow, where it softly sucked on and began to work its way under my skin.",2.73,3.09
I thought that I could feel a slight itching.,2.5,3.1
Let’s not waste any more time.”,2.63,2.87
"“They take about a quarter-pint each,”",2.9,2.8
"“They take about a quarter-pint each,” said Madame Entera, drawing out another skinny leech.",3.0,2.9
"“They’re quick, too.",3.14,3.14
We’ll be done with them before your hair is finished.”,3.1,2.6
Then she clapped her hands and brought in the barber.,3.3,3.3
"Half an hour later, I left the room pale and bald, running my fingers over my scalp.",2.5,3.25
She stood up and I followed her out to the street.,3.1,3.0
At least the barber hadn’t nicked me.,3.3,2.8
"Madame Entera took me back up to the stone’s room, where Nepthys was waiting by the door.",3.1,3.1
"“Be careful you don’t let him touch it until you’re ready to use it,”",2.9,3.2
"“Be careful you don’t let him touch it until you’re ready to use it,” the woman admonished Nepthys as she slipped the stone into a grey cloth pouch and handed it to him.",2.88,3.12
"“Thank you for doing business at our house, and I hope to see you again!”",3.9,3.4
"“Come on,”",2.8,3.4
"“Come on,” said Nepthys, “you could use a drink.”",3.18,2.64
It was dark enough that I could actually see a few stars through the screen of city light.,3.2,3.1
“you could use a drink.”,3.0,2.9
We hit a bar on the next street over.,3.12,3.0
"“Vodka, straight up,”",3.1,3.3
"“Vodka, straight up,” Nepthys told the bartender as we sat down at the counter, “and a Bloody Mary for my friend.",3.0,3.0
“and a Bloody Mary for my friend.,3.1,2.8
Make it extra bloody.”,3.0,3.3
"When our drinks came, he poured a dollop of something from an inner pocket into my Bloody Mary.",2.7,3.0
"“That should help,”",3.4,3.0
"“That should help,” he said.",3.1,3.0
“You could run on empty with a little of that stuff.,3.1,2.8
"It won’t refill your blood supply, but while that’s in your system, you won’t even need blood.”",3.12,3.0
He grinned at me.,3.9,3.2
"“Drink up, kid.”",3.12,2.88
I took about half of the Bloody Mary in one gulp and then ate the celery.,3.0,3.0
Nepthys slapped me on the back.,2.6,3.0
"“Okay,”",2.88,3.12
"“Okay,” I said, “now that we’re sitting down, can you explain a little more of what’s going on here?",3.0,3.12
"“now that we’re sitting down, can you explain a little more of what’s going on here?",2.9,3.3
"I mean, what is this place, really?”",2.7,3.1
He thought about that.,3.0,2.78
"“I think that our world is a reflection of yours, or yours is a more boring reflection of ours.",2.62,2.75
"Without hearing the car horns, I could almost taste the air of late March through the street fumes.",3.1,3.3
This place is just a little of both.,3.0,2.25
"In America, things are still weird after the European conquest.",2.9,2.7
"The natives are still here, but so is everyone else.",2.88,3.0
The Europeans mostly manifest as something like the underground society of your cities.,2.86,3.0
We aren’t quite what you’d expect from reading the Grimms.”,2.9,3.0
“What do you mean?”,3.0,3.0
"“Okay, take elves.”",3.0,2.86
He caught the bartender’s eye for another shot.,3.1,3.0
"“You figure they’re some Lincoln-green pretty boys who run around in the forest with bows and live forever in halls of glory, right?",3.0,3.0
Not in America.,2.62,2.88
"Here, they’re the snotty rich who show up in clubs because they like the ‘gritty ambience’ – you have them in your world, too, right?",2.7,3.4
Except it’s worse here because they have centuries to grow disaffected and flirt with exciting and dangerous elements of society’s lowest rungs.,2.7,3.3
"Some of them actually commit to this society, though.",3.0,2.8
There’s an amazing DJ who’s an elf.,3.75,2.75
He has a real ear for it.,2.91,2.73
"When they do decide to do something for real, they’re always the best at it.”",3.43,3.14
"If it was March, that meant that we’d been together almost a year and a half.",3.2,2.8
He downed the second shot.,3.0,3.0
“I am glad to be out of the favor-trading scene for half a minute.,3.7,3.2
It’s exhausting to talk to those people.,2.78,3.44
One wrong word and you find yourself cursed with infinite earwax or something.,2.5,3.3
"So what else do you want to know, Nathan?”",3.0,2.9
"“I don’t know …hey, what about the nature spirits, things like that?",3.0,2.9
"I mean, where do the dryads fit in a place like this?”",2.89,3.11
"“If the tree isn’t around, the dryad isn’t around.",2.6,2.8
It’s as simple as that.”,3.14,3.0
That made me a little sad.,1.89,2.89
They were always my favorite part of the Greek myths I read in elementary school.,3.3,2.9
"“Well, what about you?",3.0,3.14
"“My parents came over from Russia, just like your family.",3.11,3.0
"My real name is a little more ethnically appropriate, but we don’t toss those around in this place.",2.62,3.12
"It was last February, after the winter break, that we moved in together.",3.1,2.9
They were spirits of a certain branch of the Volga and the village based around a mill on that tributary.,3.0,3.0
"When the Russian government dammed the river, my parents decided that instead of dying with the river, they would stick with the people of the village they’d protected.",2.9,3.4
"I was born here, and I was lucky enough not to get attached to any particular river.",3.3,3.2
"Sure, I miss having a place to settle down, but it’s better than waiting to get dammed.”",2.86,3.14
He took another shot of vodka.,2.91,2.82
“Shouldn’t you be going light on the vodka?,2.89,3.11
"I mean, we might have a lot of work ahead of us.”",3.0,3.2
“Are you kidding?,2.4,3.3
"I can drink like a fish, kid.",3.2,3.1
"Now spring was back, under the concrete, and I could smell it even here.",3.1,2.9
"We should get going, though.",3.0,3.12
Still woozy?”,2.62,2.75
I nodded.,3.0,2.71
“A little walking should get the stuff into your system.,3.1,3.0
"Come on, let’s go.”",3.2,3.1
"As we left the bar, I asked to see the rock.",3.0,3.0
“Why?”,2.38,3.25
Nepthys asked.,3.0,2.29
“I’m just curious.,3.11,3.11
I want to see what a magic stone looks like.,3.0,3.14
"Don’t worry, I’ll be careful not to touch it.”",2.75,3.0
"He thought about it, then handed me the pouch.",3.0,3.0
I undid the strings and let the pouch sit on my palm so that I could see the stone inside.,3.37,3.0
"It looked like a normal river stone, a gray oval with a white stripe through it.",3.1,2.6
"As long as I looked at it, it didn’t reveal any magic sparkle or glow.",2.75,2.88
"Suddenly, what looked like a little kid darted out of an alley and almost ran into me.",2.62,3.5
"I almost tripped over him, and the stone went flying out of the pouch.",2.8,3.3
"Nepthys tried to grab it, but, by reflex, I caught it first.",3.0,3.3
"“Isn’t it an amazing night, Rache?",3.6,3.4
"Immediately, I felt it grow warm and knew that I had done something very stupid.",2.1,3.3
"“Nathan,” said Nepthys, “I think that you just did something very stupid.”",2.71,3.0
"“I agree,”",3.56,3.44
"“I agree,” I told him.",3.2,2.6
"The stone was as warm as human flesh now, and there was a sort of glow that might have been light or just the stone’s soft heat, I don’t know.",3.2,2.9
Even the city feels alive when spring comes.”,3.8,3.8
"Then there was light, a kind of rosy glow, and I felt the stone slip out of my hand to float in the air.",3.4,3.5
"The air around me seemed to still sound, and light came in around the corners of my eyes.",3.2,3.0
“Do you know what this thing does?”,3.0,3.0
"I shouted, hardly able to hear myself.",2.6,3.4
"Nepthys was saying something that looked like, “I have no idea!”",3.0,3.11
“I have no idea!”,2.5,3.5
but I couldn’t hear him.,2.5,2.7
"The light in the corners of my eyes rushed in, converging on the rosy glow around the stone, and for a moment I was blind.",2.7,3.2
“Taxi!”,3.09,3.45
There was no sign of the stone.,2.6,2.9
"“I think I understand why we got that stone from a slave shop,”",2.5,2.9
"“I think I understand why we got that stone from a slave shop,” said Nepthys.",2.9,2.8
She waved down a car and pulled me in.,3.09,3.18
"The girl was as soft and rosy as the stone’s glow, and she was dressed in a white shift tied at the waist with a belt like a Celtic knot.",3.5,3.5
"Her arms and legs were wrapped in white linen up to her wrists and ankles, and soft, white leather boots held her feet.",3.1,3.2
"When she didn’t move, I knelt down and put a hand to her brow.",2.8,3.4
"As soon as I touched her, her eyes opened into mine and she grabbed my wrist.",3.1,3.4
"In a few minutes, we were getting out a block down from the abandoned church.",3.0,3.0
I couldn’t move.,2.1,3.5
"“Name me,”",3.1,3.0
"“Name me,” she said.",3.0,3.12
"I opened my mouth to ask for an explanation, but Nepthys stopped me.",2.7,2.8
"“Don’t name her ‘What did you say?’, okay?",2.7,3.1
‘What did you say?’,3.0,3.2
The next thing that comes out of your mouth is probably what she’ll respond to until we figure out how to put her back.”,3.0,2.8
I was at a loss.,2.0,2.83
I’d never named anyone before.,2.9,3.1
I thought back to one time when I’d been thinking about raising a family and remembered that I’d always liked the name –,3.3,3.1
“Amy.”,2.91,2.55
Nepthys looked at me incredulously.,3.14,2.86
"“You awaken a magical being of unknown power from an enchanted stone, having purchased her with your own blood from a slave dealer, and you name her ‘Amy’?”",3.11,3.22
"Amy smiled at me and let go of my arm, but not before she brought my fingers to her lips and gave them one soft kiss.",3.8,3.6
"After she paid the driver, she grabbed my arm, laughing, and we ran down the street.",3.88,3.63
I stood up and Amy stood with me.,3.2,3.0
“So …back to our garlicky friend?”,3.29,2.57
"“I suppose so,”",3.0,3.0
"“I suppose so,” said Nepthys, “and you’d better pray to whatever god you think will listen that he won’t care we woke her up.”",2.75,3.25
“and you’d better pray to whatever god you think will listen that he won’t care we woke her up.”,2.3,3.4
We walked back to the herb stand.,3.12,2.88
"The vendor stared a little at Amy, his arms pausing in midair as he lit the stand’s little lamp, but we walked right around him and up the wooden stairs.",2.7,2.8
"When Nepthys opened the little man’s door, he rolled over and grinned to see us, but when Amy walked in, he blanched.",2.57,3.0
“What!”,3.1,3.8
he screamed.,2.22,3.78
“You idiots!,2.22,3.44
You woke it up?,2.75,3.12
"“But …but sir,”",2.7,3.1
"“But …but sir,” I said, “are you sure she’s no help to you?”",3.0,3.1
“are you sure she’s no help to you?”,3.0,3.0
"“Not if you named it already, you ninny, and I’m sure that you have!",2.25,3.5
I heard the pulse already.,3.1,2.9
Fools!,2.25,3.75
Get out of my sight now – unless you know how to put it back?,2.12,3.63
…I thought as much.,2.73,2.82
"Now leave, before I call the rats on you.”",2.4,3.3
We left.,2.9,3.0
Nepthys shook his hands at me like he wanted to wrap them around my neck.,2.3,3.4
"We slammed against the doorway and I was laughing too, the pulse close enough to shake the doorframe and set up vibrations in my chest, Rachel in my arms because she’d used me to soften her landing.",4.1,3.8
"“You idiot,”",1.88,3.38
“do you know how much you’ve set us back?,2.2,3.4
"I should say, set yourself back, since it’s your girlfriend we’re looking for.”",3.0,3.0
"I thought about Rachel; in the excitement, I had forgotten why we were chasing down vampire experts.",3.1,3.4
“You’re just lucky that Dvorov isn’t my only contact.,2.88,3.25
"Come on, we’re heading out.”",3.0,3.1
"ome on, we’re heading out.”",3.1,3.3
He held the door for me and Amy when we reached the bottom of the stairs.,3.4,3.0
"Walking outside, I was shocked to see that it was already dark.",2.9,3.3
"“Night comes quickly here,”",2.9,2.9
"“Night comes quickly here,” said Nepthys quietly as he came out behind me.",2.88,3.12
“Didn’t I warn you?”,2.44,3.33
"“Okay,”",3.0,2.78
"“Okay,” he said as we hit the street, “we’re going to see another friend of mine.",3.3,3.1
“we’re going to see another friend of mine.,3.1,3.0
"First, though, we are getting you a hat.",3.1,3.1
You look ridiculous with a shaved head.”,2.4,3.6
"At a nearby stand, he grabbed the first hat that would cover my head and might pass back in real Boston.",3.14,3.14
It was a black baseball cap that read “Dead Can Dance” in gold across the front.,2.89,2.89
“Dead Can Dance”,2.89,2.89
"Amy liked it, I think.",3.0,2.86
"She still hadn’t spoken since I named her, so I wasn’t sure.",3.11,3.0
"He took us to a squat, long building whose roof bulged up like the ribs of a gutted animal.",3.0,3.0
"The black door opened as we came up to it, and a pale man opened the door.",3.0,3.12
"He was naked, but there was nothing to hide: his body was hairless and completely smooth.",3.3,2.7
I only say “he” because he didn’t have a hint of femininity.,2.82,3.0
“he”,3.0,2.8
His eyes were white.,2.82,2.82
"From behind him, I could hear something that sounded like a remix of the Cure’s “A Forest”.",3.29,3.28
“A Forest”,3.0,2.9
“I’m here to see Isis.,3.0,3.0
Tell her that Nepthys is here to see her.”,3.0,3.11
The man closed his eyes.,3.0,2.27
"A moment later, he opened them again and stepped aside to let us in.",3.2,2.8
"Nepthys walked straight past him and I tried to keep up, taking Amy’s small hand so that she wouldn’t lag behind.",2.9,3.0
"I shivered as I walked past the pale man’s blank eyes, wondering what they were staring at.",2.0,3.0
Amy gave my hand a squeeze.,3.4,3.2
"Nepthys lead us down a hallway that matched the building’s façade, a vaulted, ribbed intestine of a hallway, whose black walls looked unsettlingly organic.",3.0,3.1
We kissed and slipped inside.,3.9,3.8
"Then there was a door, which opened as we approached.",3.0,3.0
"Inside, the space opened into a wide, square chamber mirrored and so dark that it could have been any size.",3.0,3.2
"The old vaulted church was stripped down: there was no cloth on the altar, just a DJ’s toolkit and his beer.",2.3,3.1
These were incontestably male.,3.0,2.75
“Nepthys!”,3.0,3.5
"said the woman, slithering up across the furs to sit up.",3.14,3.14
"As she rose, her robes fell open and I realized that, except for what looked like a red silk kimono, she was naked – naked and stunning.",3.55,3.64
I had an urge to cover Amy’s eyes.,2.89,3.22
“It’s been years since I’ve seen you.,3.64,3.55
"Please, come and sit beside me, and introduce your friends.”",3.29,3.29
"“This man is here in search of his lover, who was stolen from him in the human world,”",2.9,3.1
"“This man is here in search of his lover, who was stolen from him in the human world,” said Nepthys, ushering us toward the woman in silk.",3.0,2.88
"“The girl is …surprising,”",3.4,3.5
"“The girl is …surprising,” he concluded.",3.4,3.3
"“And I am Isis,”",2.7,3.1
"“And I am Isis,” said the woman, offering her hand to me.",3.0,3.1
"I took it and, dropping to one knee, gave her fingers a small kiss.",3.5,3.7
It seemed appropriate.,3.11,3.11
"“It is an honor to meet you, Lady Isis,”",3.5,3.6
"“It is an honor to meet you, Lady Isis,” I said.",3.9,3.4
"She laughed, liquid, alluring, alarming.",3.8,3.8
"“Oh, precious!",4.0,4.1
"He has lovely manners, Nepthys, despite his poor taste in hats.",3.4,2.7
"You may leave out the ‘Lady,’ boy.",3.0,2.9
I don’t wish to be reminded of how old I actually am.”,2.5,3.2
A wave to the pale men brought a bottle of red wine and a platter of grapes.,3.3,3.3
"Through the dark, I could see three bolts left in the wall from where they’d taken down the crucifix.",2.9,2.9
"“Now, how can I help the elegantly mannered friend of my Nepthys and his surprising young charge?",3.3,3.3
I hope I can start by offering some wine.”,3.3,3.2
Nepthys poured out wine for three of us.,3.25,2.87
"“May I have a little more of what you gave me before, Nepthys?”",3.0,3.1
I asked.,3.1,2.8
“I still feel a little woozy.”,2.3,3.1
He poured a dollop of the clear liquid into one cup and passed it to me.,3.11,2.78
"The wine’s rich scent had a touch of something chemical that I recognized from the bar, but it filled my mouth and sank into my veins with reassuring warmth.",3.37,3.13
Isis’ nostrils twitched slightly.,2.88,2.88
This story might be interesting.,3.2,3.2
Does it have anything to do with why your head is shaved?”,3.0,3.0
"“It was part of the price for this girl, who was a rock at the time,”",3.0,2.88
"“It was part of the price for this girl, who was a rock at the time,” explained Nepthys.",3.11,3.11
"“I have a feeling that she was worth the trade,”",3.29,3.29
"“I have a feeling that she was worth the trade,” I added.",3.29,3.0
"Amy, still holding my hand, smiled.",4.1,3.5
"“She may be at that,”",3.0,2.9
"“She may be at that,” said Isis, gazing at her.",3.0,2.83
"“That sweet, small nose, and her soft lips – she’d kiss well, I should think, if gently.",3.82,3.37
"A confessional too beaten-up to have been sold was shaking in a way that suggested activity inside, and where the pews had been taken out, a couple hundred people were testifying to the DJ’s moving sermon.",3.25,3.13
She has good blood under her cheeks.,3.22,2.89
"Good, round breasts, too, even though they’re small, they suit her.”",3.75,3.62
"Amy didn’t blush, and I hoped that she didn’t understand what Isis was saying.",2.86,3.14
"“She would have been worth it,”",3.2,3.6
"“She would have been worth it,” Nepthys interrupted, “if this fool hadn’t accidentally woken her up before we could give her to our contact.",2.7,3.1
“if this fool hadn’t accidentally woken her up before we could give her to our contact.,2.3,3.2
He was going to give us valuable information for her.”,3.2,3.1
"“Now I understand why you’re here,”",3.12,3.12
"“Now I understand why you’re here,” said Isis.",3.2,3.0
“So what do you need to know?”,3.0,3.0
"“You know I wouldn’t come to you if I could get this information another way,”",2.9,3.2
"“You know I wouldn’t come to you if I could get this information another way,” said Nepthys apologetically.",2.8,2.9
"“Mmm,”",3.5,2.9
I couldn’t tell what the thoughtful look on her face meant.,3.0,2.91
“I think that the person who stole the girl we’re looking for might be a vampire.,2.7,3.2
"Isis …you know some way to locate the undead, don’t you?”",2.9,3.0
“I do.,3.1,2.9
Describe this one to me.,3.0,2.8
"If I know him, I can find him.",3.0,3.29
"If not, you’ll have to bring me something to work with.”",2.78,2.89
Nepthys looked at me.,3.12,2.62
"I thought back to seeing the man in the hollow church and described his skin, his dark hair, the way that light seemed to flow around him, as best as I could.",3.0,3.1
"Isis set her elbows in the fur and rested her head on her hands while I spoke and tried not to stare at her full, hanging breasts.",3.1,3.5
"When I had told her all that I could remember, she blinked her black lashes and said, “I remember him.”",3.1,3.2
“You do?”,2.86,3.29
Nepthys could hardly believe her.,2.71,3.14
“That’s amazing!”,4.3,4.2
“It is.,3.0,2.9
I would have sworn to you that he was dead.,2.6,3.2
He should be.,3.11,2.89
I hope that you can do a better job than the last lot.”,2.6,3.4
"She sat up, running her hands along her pale, round thighs.",3.2,3.1
"“All right, then.",3.0,2.4
Let me see if I can find him.”,3.0,2.86
Isis closed her eyes and lifted her hands.,3.0,2.86
A dark glow coalesced around her palms.,2.9,3.0
"Amy leaned forward, looking amazed.",3.55,3.45
"The glow reflected on her pink face, casting a sickly pallor over her heartbeat-strong cheeks.",2.38,3.38
Tiny drops of blood began to seep out of Isis’ palms as her brow creased.,2.4,3.2
Her candy lips twisted into a frown.,2.44,3.22
"The dark glow grew stronger and larger, filling the air for about a foot around her hands.",2.75,3.25
"Rachel stepped forward into the crowd while I took a moment to drink in the ceiling’s blue-lit, shadowed vault and the light-catching haze from who-knows-what rising between the DJ and the crowd.",3.2,3.4
"In her palms, the droplets of blood swelled into small pools.",2.5,3.4
"The dark glow began to flicker, and Isis’ frown of concentration became one of worry.",2.8,3.0
The pools in her hands grew deeper.,3.0,2.89
"She didn’t shed a bead of sweat, and I didn’t even see her draw a breath, but the glow around her hands shuddered like a stubborn candleflame.",2.9,2.9
Then her fingers tensed and her arms began to shake.,2.8,3.2
"The blood in her palms, still filling up, began to ripple.",2.88,3.25
"Shivers swept through her body, and Nepthys reached out to touch her but I stopped him.",2.6,3.6
"He glanced at me with honest concern, probably the first honest moment he’d shown me: ‘Is she all right?’",3.11,3.11
‘Is she all right?’,2.7,3.5
"Her hands twitched and a drop of blood shook out, splashing on the crease of her thigh and hanging to one strand of the black hair between her legs.",2.43,3.29
"She gasped and the dark glow went out, taking the blood with it in a flash of heat and red steam.",2.8,3.2
"Isis collapsed on the fur, strings cut.",2.6,3.4
"Now Nepthys lunged forward, took her by the arms.",3.0,3.4
"“Isis, what happened?",2.9,3.2
"She shook her head, rubbing her face into the white fur and murmuring something.",2.9,3.1
“What did you say?”,2.75,3.0
asked Nepthys.,3.0,2.86
"She rolled onto her back, her arms crossed tightly over her chest.",2.9,3.3
"For the first time, she looked vulnerable.",2.7,2.9
"When she finally spoke, I had to lean close to hear her.",3.0,3.0
"“I found your vampire,”",3.1,3.5
"“I found your vampire,” she said, “but he might know that someone’s looking for him.",2.7,3.5
“but he might know that someone’s looking for him. He’s taken great pains to keep himself hidden.,2.8,3.1
He’s taken great pains to keep himself hidden.,2.6,2.9
You should look for him at Dvorov’s as quickly as you can.”,3.0,3.2
She turned to me with tired sympathy.,2.9,2.8
“I didn’t see a girl with him.,2.8,2.9
"Hurry, though, and you might find him before he leaves.”",2.9,3.1
A twitch of her fingers summoned her pale servants.,3.14,3.14
“One of these will lead you out.”,3.0,3.0
"I stood, and one of her servants took me and Amy to the door.",3.0,2.9
I looked back to see Nepthys whispering something to her.,3.1,3.1
"He stood to go, but she caught his sleeve and pulled him back for a moment.",3.0,3.4
"There was a terrific echo, each beat reverberating inside of the next, and the old stained-glass windows rattled in their frames.",2.7,3.1
I turned back to the door.,3.0,2.78
"“Come on, Amy,” I said, “he’ll be along soon.”",3.2,3.3
Nepthys caught up with us after a minute and walked silently to the end of the hall.,3.0,2.78
"When we got there, another pale servant was waiting for us with a box of dark stained wood.",2.89,2.78
"He offered it to Nepthys, who opened the box: on velvet lining, a wooden hammer and two stakes.",2.9,3.0
"“Mountain ash,”",3.0,3.0
"“Mountain ash,” said Nepthys.",2.88,2.5
“That was very kind of her.”,3.62,2.88
"Closing the box, he paused beside the open door and looked back at me.",3.2,3.1
"“I really hope we find your Rachel,”",2.86,2.86
"“I really hope we find your Rachel,” he said.",3.25,3.12
"“I know a quick way to Dvorov’s,”",3.4,2.9
"“I know a quick way to Dvorov’s,” said Nepthys.",3.0,2.8
“I bet he’s kicking himself now for not having a way to contact me.”,2.86,3.29
"In a few minutes, we were back to the first door we’d knocked on in this town and Dvorov himself was greeting us.",3.4,3.5
The pulse from inside made the building sound like a giant heart.,3.0,3.2
"“Yo, my man Nep!",3.8,3.8
You got the sucker already?”,3.1,3.0
"“No, but we got a tip that he might be in your club.",3.0,2.9
Have you seen him?”,3.0,3.1
"“Here, man?",3.1,2.7
You’re crazy.,2.57,3.43
I haven’t had a vampire here since you and – ” Nepthys shot a wicked look at him.,2.8,3.3
"“Anyway, long time, man.”",2.9,3.0
“That’s odd.,2.5,3.3
"On the dance floor, people moved with their eyes closed and their hands in the air.",3.5,3.4
Do you mind if we check it out anyway?,3.0,2.9
I have a real feeling that he’s in here somewhere.”,3.0,3.1
"Dvorov glanced over his shoulder, a little nervous.",2.44,3.33
"“I guess, man, but be quick.",3.0,3.2
"I don’t want my customers thinkin’ that anything’s wrong, you know?”",2.4,3.1
We’ll be in and out in a minute.”,3.0,2.63
Nepthys stepped in and Dvorov walked us towards the dance floor.,3.1,3.2
Dvorov asked us.,3.0,2.88
"“No, he said that his research was purely academic, not for hunters.”",3.0,3.0
“Bummer.,2.11,3.22
"I guess I probably should’ve known, though.",2.25,2.75
"I mean, he is kinda tight about that stuff.”",2.9,3.0
He didn’t look very surprised.,2.4,2.6
"“Anyway, this is the dance floor, man.",3.1,3.1
Good luck.”,3.6,3.1
"Something with too many arms was manning the turntables above the crowd, which looked more impenetrable tonight than ever before.",3.0,2.88
Then I saw the bar on the other side of the crowd and knew where to start looking.,3.1,3.2
"I danced with Rachel for a while, but then something by the bar seemed to be pulling her eyes.",2.9,3.2
I tried to slip along the edge of the crowd.,2.88,2.75
"Things with scales and claws kept flailing against me, pressing me into the wall, but I took a breath and kept moving.",2.5,3.7
My nose filled with a reek of thick sweat.,2.38,2.87
"The music began to build, and a strobe came on.",3.25,3.25
"Somewhere toward the center of the dance floor, I heard a howl that sent bitter winds under my clothing – for a second, I was back with my family in Russia, hiding from the cold.",2.6,3.5
Then I felt a tug on the back of my shirt and noticed that Amy was following me.,3.17,2.83
I gathered her under my arm.,3.1,2.8
"Dvorov was somewhere behind me, too, negotiating delicately through his patrons.",3.1,2.8
"Just in front of me, a massive thing slammed into the wall, sending up a cloud of granite dust.",2.71,3.0
It slumped to the floor and I realized that it was a werewolf.,2.63,3.5
Its haunches twitched in time to the music.,3.2,3.1
"As it started to rise, a man with thick, scaled skin stretched across rippling muscles leapt on him.",2.88,3.38
She told me that she was heading for a drink and slipped out of the crowd.,3.0,2.88
I thought that my odds were better on the dance floor.,3.2,3.1
"Holding Amy in my arms as we ducked between the crush of dancers, I started to wonder if the chances of finding this vampire were even good enough to merit this.",3.0,3.3
"A cold thing with countless, writhing tentacles fell against me, thrashing as if in the throes of a drug overdose, tripping me and clutching at my limbs.",2.73,3.0
"A woman who could have been an elf twitched and jerked beside me, fingers trembling at the torn edges of her clothing.",3.0,3.25
"Then a looming shape to my right fell away, and I saw him in a flash of the strobe, his black eyes staring deadly into the crowd.",2.44,3.56
"The creature blocking my vision moved back, but I had seen all that I needed to see.",3.12,3.12
"A bleeding, eyeless thing shuddered and beat its arms against me, but I ducked around it and toward the bar.",2.7,3.3
"When she hadn’t come back halfway through the next song, I glanced over at the bar.",3.0,3.0
"I slipped past the waving monstrosity that had blocked my view before, a mountain of wet, veined flesh, and had almost passed through the crowd when a clawed hand grabbed my arm.",2.3,3.5
It was Dvorov.,2.9,2.7
He pulled my ear down to his mouth.,2.8,3.5
"“You seen enough, man?”",2.7,3.3
he shouted.,2.4,3.8
"“Yes,”",3.5,3.3
"“Yes,” I called back, “I saw him!",3.4,3.9
“I saw him!,3.0,3.5
He’s sitting right there at the bar!”,3.0,3.43
"Dvorov tried to peek through the crowd, but it had shifted again and we couldn’t see a thing.",2.6,2.9
"“I don’t think he’s there,”",2.8,2.9
“It must have been wishful thinking.”,2.4,2.9
"“No, I saw him!",2.7,4.2
"I have to hurry, too!",2.62,4.0
Who knows how long he’ll stick around?”,3.0,3.25
"“Listen, man, he’s not there!",2.7,4.0
"I’m telling you, it’s not even worth checking the bar!”",2.3,3.6
"I turned to keep going, but he caught my arm again.",2.33,3.33
"“Don’t do this, kid!",2.36,4.09
"It was just a little set-up where someone had stacked a few crates and brought something alcoholic to share, mostly beer.",3.1,2.9
It’s a dumb idea.,2.38,3.0
"Even if you did find this vampire cat, he’d tear you apart!",2.7,3.7
"I shook him off and squeezed between two dancing nymphs, getting almost to the edge of the dance floor.",3.0,3.57
"Suddenly, Amy screamed.",2.0,3.71
I whirled around and threw up my arm just in time to knock Dvorov away.,2.71,3.71
"His eyes were glowing red, and he had bared a set of fangs that could probably take my hand off.",2.5,3.4
The dancers near us tried to clear some space.,2.9,2.8
"He shot back up, hardly touching the ground, and I kicked him back.",2.75,3.5
"He jumped at my arm while I was still off-balance, and I felt the surge of adrenaline that comes right when your body realizes that it’s too late to save itself.",2.9,3.2
"On the floor was Dvorov’s head, separated from his body by several feet and a growing puddle of dark blood.",2.2,3.6
Nepthys stood over him with a blue sword in his hand.,2.8,3.4
It flashed in the strobe where it wasn’t streaked with Dvorov’s blood.,2.7,2.9
"“He wasn’t the only one with a secret or two,”",3.1,3.1
"“He wasn’t the only one with a secret or two,” he said by way of explanation.",2.8,2.9
"“You spotted our boy, didn’t you?",3.2,3.5
"I bet his hide-out is nearby, too.",3.0,3.0
Let’s hurry.”,3.1,3.4
"Rachel was standing with a plastic cup, looking like she was having a conversation, but I couldn’t see anyone else there.",2.9,3.0
He wiped off the sword and sheathed it in a scabbard now belted to his hip.,3.0,2.88
The crowd parted for us.,3.2,2.9
The vampire glanced up when he saw the crowd split and his eyes flashed when he noticed us.,2.8,3.6
"In a blink of the strobe light, he was on his feet and dashing from the room.",3.2,3.3
“Come on!”,2.75,3.5
shouted Nepthys.,3.2,3.2
"We chased after him, Amy keeping up valiantly behind us.",2.8,3.4
"He bashed up a set of stairs set into the side of the wall, and we chased up after him, heading up a huge staircase that seemed to go up for more stories than the building could have held.",2.62,3.75
"Luckily, the vampire turned off after three stories.",3.1,3.2
"He ran down a hallway and slipped behind one of the doors, but Nepthys was close behind him and left it open for me.",3.0,2.8
I called out to Amy to shut the door in case the vampire had any friends who might be trying to follow us.,2.75,3.37
Inside was a dark room that looked like a storage space for DJ equipment.,3.0,2.88
"Nepthys urged me on from the back of the room, then made a turn out of sight.",3.1,3.4
"When I came to the door at the end of the room, it looked like it had been torn off its hinges.",2.6,3.5
"I didn’t imagine that Nepthys had done it, and it wasn’t without alarm that I ran after him.",2.44,3.44
A black hallway opened into a space like a cathedral.,3.1,2.9
"The vault rose into obscurity above me, and a massive rose window stood ahead of me.",3.0,3.2
"The panes looked dyed black, and only a few cold beams slipped through the filter.",2.82,2.73
"Footsteps echoed through the stone chamber, and the sound reflected back to me from everywhere.",3.0,3.17
"When I asked her if she'd ever seen them – before I was old enough to stop believing, I mean – she would always look sad and tell me, ""No, not since the family came to America has anything happened to us.",2.71,2.71
"I couldn’t tell how many people were running, much less where they were.",2.75,2.88
"On the steps in front of the altar, I saw pale forms and realized that they were Rachel and two other women.",2.9,3.3
"He stood in front of a blue light, so I couldn’t see him clearly, but what I saw was memorable.",3.2,3.4
"Then I heard Nepthys shout, “Nathan!",2.9,3.7
“Nathan!,3.27,4.0
Behind you!”,2.8,4.1
"I whirled and dropped in time to see the vampire shoot over my head, leaping like a panther.",2.8,3.3
"There was Nepthys, on the other side of the pews, holding the wooden box in his hand.",3.22,2.78
"He tossed it to me, and I just barely had it open before I saw the vampire again, turning to face me.",2.8,3.4
I pulled out the hammer and one of the stakes.,3.22,3.22
"He leapt over the pews, soaring like a grasshopper, and drew a gleaming knife in midair.",2.75,3.12
"I dodged, but he tossed it, and I held the box in front of my face.",2.8,3.1
"The blade lodged in the wood, its silver point penetrating the velvet and nearly reaching my skin.",2.62,3.5
My arms shook from the force of his throw.,2.4,3.4
Then he landed heavy beside me and I scrambled to stand.,2.6,3.4
"His first move pulled out the dagger, almost wrenching my arms from their sockets as I held on to the box, and the second shattered the box with a crushing punch that sent me reeling backwards.",2.5,3.12
"He wore a jacket of what might have been blue velvet, and his hair gleamed black against his white skin.",3.4,3.2
"I dropped the splinters and the broken second stake and raised my hammer, ready to drive the ash spike into his heart.",2.75,3.37
"Behind him, I saw Nepthys running between the pews.",3.0,2.9
I braced my legs against the stone floor and he was on me.,3.0,3.63
I raised the stake; he drew back the dagger for a slash that could doubtless open my neck from throat to spine.,2.3,3.8
"The stake went down, there was a blur, and then my hands were empty and I felt pain under my jaw.",2.11,3.33
"Two points of fire opened in my throat for an instant, then all went numb.",2.4,3.2
"Taste, hearing and touch became a single blur, and I do not know if my eyes were open.",2.8,3.3
"My mind began to dissipate, but then I felt the pain withdraw and a lifeless voice said, “This one’s blood isn’t worth drinking.”",2.71,3.29
“This one’s blood isn’t worth drinking.”,2.6,3.1
Hands closed on my neck and I felt my spine crack.,1.9,3.8
I must have fallen to the floor then.,2.3,3.0
"I could perceive Nepthys’ sword flashing over me, and I heard steel crack, then bone.",2.38,3.25
"The blue haze seemed to stop just shy of his pallor, setting off his striking face without illuminating its details, and his wrists flashed white in the darkness.",2.9,3.1
I thought I heard Rachel’s voice blearily calling for me.,2.75,3.0
Then one set of footsteps began walking toward the altar.,2.9,2.8
"I was content to let myself drift away, and I had almost forgotten the body lying with broken neck on the cathedral’s hard tiles when I felt a warm touch on its cheek.",2.7,3.3
"A girl’s voice, soft and almost recognizable, spoke, “Nathan.”",3.1,3.1
“Nathan.”,3.0,2.63
I felt my head turn and something in my neck reconnected.,3.2,2.9
Then my eyes opened and Amy handed me the hammer and stake.,3.0,3.2
I stood and turned toward the altar.,3.0,3.0
The vampire was walking just steps ahead of me.,2.56,3.56
"I stepped up behind him and raised my hands, which almost seemed to be glowing.",3.3,3.4
"Then the stake came down into his back and one, two, three strikes with the hammer drove it in.",2.3,3.5
The vampire fell forward and blood began to flow from his mouth.,2.38,3.38
"Behind me, Amy was kneeling beside Nepthys, whose arm and rib cage were knitting back together like a wooden toy that falls apart when its string is released but draws itself together at a slight tug.",3.0,2.71
I pulled the vial of liquid that he’d been giving me from his pocket and ran to the altar.,3.0,3.29
"Rachel, her clothes torn and her face drawn, looked like she might cry when she saw me.",2.33,4.0
I pulled her into my arms and she tried to put hers around me.,3.7,3.8
"“My fuckin’ hero,”",3.5,3.9
"“My fuckin’ hero,” she whispered.",3.8,3.7
"He didn’t move, just stared and held his drink.",2.9,2.5
"The next time I saw them, his mouth was moving.",3.0,2.9
She nodded and he took her arm.,3.1,2.9
"I watched them through the crush of dancers as they squeezed along the wall, and the feeling came to me that something was very wrong.",2.4,3.5
"Saturday morning, I woke up and saw that she still hadn’t come home.",2.5,3.2
"I called Mitch and our other friends, hoping that she’d crashed at one of their houses, but I had no luck.",2.4,3.0
"A couple of them remembered seeing her leave, but none of them had seen the thin man with her.",3.0,3.0
"I didn’t know how they could miss such exotic features, even in that distorting light.",2.78,2.78
Nathan’s Bylichka,3.0,2.8
I caught a taxi back to the church.,3.0,2.88
"It was still a mess, but everything bigger than a soda can had disappeared.",2.6,3.0
I walked across what had been the dance floor.,2.9,3.0
"The church was completely different now: sunlight fell through the stained glass, catching dust that still hung in the air and sending a dry, healthy warmth into the edges of the room, through the stone and the powdery concrete that had been covered last night by flesh and flashing lights.",3.1,2.8
"I realized that Rachel had disappeared without leaving a clue and I had no way to do anything but wait for her to show up – which, if she were in a situation where I should be doing something, would probably be never.",2.4,2.7
"Standing in the center of the church, I took out my cell phone and called the police.",2.8,3.2
“I need to file a missing persons report.,2.3,2.8
…Rachel Frieze.,2.82,2.91
"Last night, walking on West 2nd street around – maybe eleven or twelve o’clock.",3.0,2.86
What?,2.9,3.0
"…But, sir, this is an unusual situation.",2.7,3.0
"She didn’t come home last night, none of her friends have seen her.",2.4,3.5
"But if you ever should see a faerie, tell him that you are of the blood of Ivan Bogatyrivitch and he will not pass you by so quickly.""",3.1,3.2
"…Sir, if she’s in any danger, it will probably be too late to help her by that time.",2.4,3.3
"My girlfriend has disappeared, I don’t even know where to start looking, and I need help!",1.57,4.0
"…Yes, sir.",3.1,2.8
I understand.”,3.0,2.71
The police wouldn’t file a report for someone who’d been missing overnight.,2.7,3.0
"Walking out of the church, a little gust of cold air caught me by surprise.",2.9,3.1
A cold front must have hit while I was inside.,2.82,2.91
"Glancing down the street, I realized that I didn’t have a friend to drive me home this time, and it was a long walk back to the streets where taxis ran.",2.5,3.1
"I pulled my T-shirt’s sleeves down my arms as far as they’d go, but I wasn’t ready for cold.",2.9,3.1
Walking didn’t build up much heat; it just moved the air enough to chill me more.,2.75,3.0
"After I’d walked about a block, a car rolled up behind me.",2.63,2.75
It slowed down as it neared me and I started to worry.,2.2,3.4
This wasn’t the best of neighborhoods.,2.6,3.0
I kept my eyes straight ahead and tried to walk more quickly without showing it.,2.9,3.3
I heard an automatic window roll down.,3.0,3.1
"“Hey,” said a male voice, “do you need some help?”",3.0,3.3
I turned around.,3.0,2.9
"The man looked over forty, and he was driving a car I’d be afraid to drive on this street.",2.5,3.1
"“It’s a long way to anywhere worth going,”",2.91,3.09
he said.,3.0,2.75
“Would you like some help?”,3.2,2.9
"“Ah, I think I’m fine, thanks,”",3.44,2.78
"“Ah, I think I’m fine, thanks,” I told him, and turned back to the sidewalk.",3.38,3.12
"As I got older, I shook the tales off with a nod and a ""Yes, Nana.""",3.0,2.5
"“Really, I’d like to help.",3.4,3.5
"Please, hop in.",3.2,2.8
You don’t look dressed for this weather.”,2.7,2.9
I glanced back over my shoulder.,2.8,3.2
"“No thanks, sir!",2.63,3.5
I’m just fine.,3.4,3.0
"Really, don’t worry about me.”",2.8,2.9
"“Nathan Spencer, I offer you help.",3.2,3.2
I advise that you not refuse me a third time.”,2.1,3.3
"I stopped and looked back at him, surprised.",3.0,3.8
He met my eyes coolly.,2.9,2.9
“How do you know my name?”,2.8,3.3
“I know your family.,3.0,2.9
Get in.,2.9,3.1
"We have a lot of work ahead of us, and it’s best to start now.”",2.9,3.0
"""Yes, Nana.""",3.1,3.0
I walked around the car and got into the passenger seat.,3.0,2.5
"Before I had my belt on, we were rolling forward.",2.8,2.7
"“Okay,”",3.09,2.64
"“Okay,” I said.",2.9,2.8
“I’m in the car.,3.0,3.1
"Now, will you tell me how you know my family, and how you happened to be driving by just now?",2.75,3.25
"I got older and went to school, then to college, and I replaced the dreams my Nana gave me with the music DJs mixed for crowds in clubs, webs of pulse that shook us until we could believe anything.",2.91,3.0
"In fact, why didn’t you call me by name the first time?",2.7,3.3
And how did you recognize me when – ”,3.1,3.2
“That’s enough!,2.6,3.7
I can only answer one question at a time.,2.9,3.0
I know your family because an ancestor of mine made a bargain with an ancestor of yours.,3.2,3.3
"I am here now because you called for help, and no-one else would answer.”",2.9,3.5
He turned onto the next street and shifted up.,3.0,3.0
"Also, international competitors drew on a large supply of very cheap labor.",2.9,2.9
"Jobs were scarce in other steel-exporting countries, and labor laws were either non-existent or allowed employers to pay much less for work.",2.7,3.2
"Labor costs in America continued to go up, draining US companies of their resources, while companies overseas were able to cut labor costs and put that money back into updating and renovating their facilities.",2.89,3.11
"On a worldwide scale, newer materials such as aluminum, plastic, and composites were beginning to substitute steel both at home and abroad.",3.0,2.57
"Steel demand worldwide was beginning to decline, and it affected both domestic and foreign companies.",2.7,3.1
"However, to American companies already suffering financial setbacks, outdated machinery, and fierce competition, this lack of demand was an inconvenience they could not afford.",2.3,3.1
"America’s steel remained unsold, flooding the world market with inferior products that no one wanted to buy.",2.8,3.1
"Since this problem was a national one rather than a local one, the problems that were occurring in Youngstown were not unique.",3.0,3.0
"Youngstown was perhaps hit harder than any other town by the collapse of the steel industry, but it was not alone.",2.2,3.4
"The problem was a national one, involving many more mills and issues than Youngstown’s alone.",2.4,2.7
"J. Philip Richley, a union member and organizer of many attempts to save 5the mills, has summed it up thus: “You just can’t solve a nation-wide problem in a single city.”",2.9,3.0
“You just can’t solve a nation-wide problem in a single city.”,2.9,3.0
The decline of the world steel market affected not just Youngstown but the entire steel community in America.,2.5,3.1
Trying to prop up one city’s mills was impossible when faced with the depression that spread throughout the entire industry.,2.71,3.14
The Save Our Valley Campaign: Lack of Funds and Plans,2.5,3.0
"Eventually, some religious leaders involved in the Ecumenical Coalition joined forces within community members and former steel mill employees to create the Save Our Valley Campaign.",3.18,3.0
"As the name suggests, local leaders wanted to instill the people of Youngstown with a fierce sense of urgency, driving them forward to confront steel companies and owners and help secure the future of the region.",3.11,3.22
The events that would follow this date (known as Black Monday) are seen by the people who witnessed them either as stories of great courage and determination or as monuments to human failure and false hope.,2.8,2.7
"Marches, speeches, and letter writing were all employed to help stimulate the Campaign and rally the people.",3.2,3.1
But the Campaign was bogged down heavily by the lack of proper funding.,2.6,2.7
"The people of Youngstown, being now unemployed had very little money to spend on anything but staying alive.",2.22,3.0
"College tuition, clothes, food, and heating all had to come before donations to non-profit organizations.",2.9,2.9
"People outside of the area had no personal investment in the mills, and so it was difficult to convince anyone from out of the county to contribute funds.",2.8,2.7
"The lack of money proved to be crippling, because it prevented the organizations involved from purchasing the mills to run collectively.",2.78,3.0
"Without funds, the Save Our Valley Campaign could do nothing major to help salvage the city’s dying economy.",2.4,2.8
The Save Our Valley Campaign also lacked one essential component: an actual concrete plan.,2.45,2.73
No one seemed to know just how to go about fixing the problems.,2.3,3.1
"Letters and petitions were all very well, but they did little to improve the situation.",2.56,3.0
"People clung to vague ideas of worker collectivization, but no one could really fathom exactly how that would work; the people of Youngstown were, after all, not particularly familiar with socialism or collectivization in general.",3.0,2.8
"Beyond that, no one knew how they should proceed: everyone knew that saving the mills was important, but nobody stepped forward with a full-fledged plan to do it without losing huge amounts of money and dragging even more people down.",2.27,3.18
"Without funds to drive the efforts, or even a real plan of action, the Save Our Valley Campaign did more harm than good.",2.6,3.3
"In effect, it raised the hopes of workers without having any real chance at saving anything.",2.7,2.7
"People became excited and waited for the mills to reappear, but they never did.",2.89,3.33
The Campaign failed to save any jobs and Youngstown was plunged into economic chaos.,2.44,2.78
The Apathy of USWA,2.75,3.12
United Steel Workers of America was the union representing the Youngstown steel workers when the closings hit.,3.0,3.0
Initially many assumed that their union would take a lead role in fighting for the recovery of their jobs.,3.0,3.2
"However, it soon became clear that although the local union leaders were prepared to fight, the international branch was not.",3.1,2.8
"Rather than sit back and wait for their jobs to be snatched away, the workers and local union members in the mills fought long and hard to be able to keep the factories open.",3.0,3.33
"The higher levels of the union became increasingly disassociated with Youngstown and its plight, attempting to shut out the appeals from workers and local union representatives and to ignore what was really happening.",2.4,3.2
"Actually, one main reason for the behavior of the USWA was that union leaders really had no idea what to do.",2.8,2.9
"No one had ever seen a shutdown of this magnitude and rapidity before, and none of the leaders of USWA, not even president Lynn Williams, knew what could be done.",2.9,2.9
"It was clear to everyone that the economic fallout from this series of closings would be one of the worst in US history, and so without any real precedents the union leaders were flustered.",2.5,3.2
"Rather than try and come up with some sort of scenario, the USWA simply ignored what was going on in Youngstown, hoping that perhaps the problem would resolve itself, or at least not spread any further than it already had.",2.5,3.0
"Besides incompetence, the USWA had one other major reason for rejecting their local counterpart: fear of socialism.",2.5,2.9
"Obviously the union itself was not afraid of socialist action, but they worried that the federal government might see the efforts of Youngstown workers to collectivize as a movement towards socialism and perhaps even communism.",2.8,3.0
"If the USWA supported the efforts to revive the mills and encouraged worker control and ownership of the factories, then the government (and potentially other important people and institutions as well) might begin to think that the UWSA leaders were encouraging socialism.",2.75,3.12
"This would mean that UWSA would lose credibility with the American government and its people, something they could not afford to do.",2.5,3.0
"Therefore, they decided to withdraw support and let the local branch fight it out alone.",2.8,2.8
Regionalism,3.0,2.6
From its very first days the Mahoning Valley has been an area packed with small villages and hamlets.,3.1,3.0
"Youngstown is the name of the major city area, but surrounding it on all sides are small communities which to the casual viewer are indistinguishable from the main city itself.",3.0,3.0
"Petitions, protests, rallies, collectivization, and even the takeover of a steel company’s headquarters were all attempted in a desperate movement by those in the industry to preserve the only source of employment that this town had.",2.44,3.0
"Boardman, Poland Township, Struthers, Lowellville, Warren, Lordstown, Canfield, Niles, and many other towns and districts are crowded around Youngstown (see Figure 3).",2.8,2.9
"People from each town work, shop, eat, and socialize in towns separate from their own, making each town strongly dependent on every other town.",3.0,3.0
"However, although traffic is heavy between each separate district, each area has its own distinct cultural ethnicity, educational system, heritage, history, and even food.",3.1,3.1
"For example, Struthers is a poor town with a large Slovak population, where education is generally better than in surrounding towns, but unemployment is much higher and pollution is widespread.",3.0,2.7
Most people in Struthers are either Orthodox or Baptist.,3.0,2.78
"Two blocks over one finds Boardman, a well-off township with a reputation for rich but unsuccessful schools.",2.7,2.9
"Its residents are mainly Italian and Roman Catholic, with a small concentration of Methodists on the east side.",3.0,3.1
"Unemployment is low in comparison with surrounding towns, and the streets are clean and well kept.",3.7,3.3
"With many more cultures, religions, and economic levels living in close proximity to one another, a curious phenomenon has overtaken the area: regionalism.",3.0,2.5
"Each town, with their own identity, instills a strong regionalistic feeling within their respective populations, which dictates many habits, exchanges, and interactions between populations.",3.1,2.7
"Oftentimes this regionalism takes the form of bizarre forms of hatred, with certain towns becoming sworn enemies of others.",2.2,3.2
"With so much regional tension, it became very hard for workers to unite under a common cause, even one that would save their jobs and their futures.",2.62,2.88
"Workers from Poland Township would refuse to attend rallies with workers from Campbell, and citizens of Struthers would become suspicious of people from Boardman, even if they were supposed to be working towards the same thing.",2.78,3.11
"A lack of cooperation became a crippling problem for the movement, because no one was willing to put aside regional differences to work together.",2.75,3.25
"In some instances, small companies would express interest in helping the movement or in relocating their business in the area, but because of regional pride no one could ever agree where the new businesses should relocate.",2.88,3.0
In this way the people of the Mahoning Valley missed many opportunities for new industrial or commercial lifeblood because of arbitrary arguments where the goal was simply to protect regional pride.,2.9,3.2
"These well-intentioned efforts ultimately failed, leaving thousands with shattered dreams and a distinct lack of trust in fellow humankind.",2.13,3.13
Conclusion: The Aftershock and the Significance of Black Monday,2.9,2.8
Black Monday was a devastating blow to an entire generation of people.,2.0,3.72
"The efforts to avoid catastrophe after the fact were unsuccessful for four main reasons: the failure of the international steel market, the lack of funds and plans in initiatives such as the Save Our Valley Campaign, the refusal of the USWA to support their local chapter out of ineptitude and fear, and the absurd but very real regionalism which corrupted solidarity efforts and drove away any hope for brining in new companies.",2.7,3.2
"What happened in Youngstown may not seem significant on an international or even on a national level, and perhaps it is not.",2.9,2.9
"But to the thousands of people living there, the loss of the mills was a devastating event that sent shock waves through their economic, political, and social futures.",2.6,3.0
"Because of the mills and their conspicuous absence, hundreds of people were uprooted, forced to leave their homes and tightly knit communities.",2.3,3.2
"Hundreds more joined the unemployment lines, or even began living on the streets.",2.63,3.12
"For the people of Youngstown, Black Monday was not just a historical event- it was the most important event in their lives.",3.0,2.75
"The steel workers who tried to save their jobs and their lives were part of something greater than themselves, something which would endure long after they had moved away and moved on.",3.1,3.2
"Even though they eventually failed, the fact that they tried to preserve what they felt belonged to them is an amazing example of how far people will go to save their lives and the futures of their children.",3.1,3.2
But why did the brave attempts by union leaders and concerned citizens to revive the steel industry ultimately fail?,2.75,2.87
An Extended Essay in History,3.0,2.75
"When examining the area’s history, culture, and economic situation we can identify four main reasons: the refusal of the international leadership of United Steelworkers of America to support their union’s Youngstown branch, the lagging international steel market, the lack of a clear, organized vision for individual initiatives such as the Save Our Valley Campaign, and crippling regionalism which caused animosity between different small towns in the region, all contributed in some way to the failure of the workers and union leaders to save the industry.",2.63,3.12
"Most importantly, the problem in Youngstown was a nationwide problem.",2.5,3.37
"Although it affected Youngstown and the surrounding area more than it affected other regions, the local people simply could not solve a national crisis on a local level.",2.5,3.1
A Brief History of Steel in Northeastern Ohio,3.12,3.0
In 1802 James and Daniel Heaton discovered ore and coal lining Yellow Creek in an area outside of Youngstown known as Poland Township.,3.1,3.1
"Their blast furnace, “Hopewell,” was the very first blast furnace in the area.",2.89,2.89
"During the Civil War, Youngstown played a vital role in supplying the Union army with iron products.",3.11,2.56
"Youngstown also was a major railway crossroads, due to its strategic position between Cleveland, Pittsburgh, New York, and Chicago.",2.89,3.0
The Decline of the Northeastern Ohio Steel Market: Why Did Attempts by Union Leaders and Concerned Citizens to Revive the Steel Industry Ultimately Fail?,2.5,3.2
"In fact, “More rail cars passed under the Center Street Bridge [a major bridge in Youngstown] per day than any other location in the country.”",3.1,3.0
"During the 19th century, the center of iron manufacturing had gradually shifted from the far East Coast (Massachusetts and Eastern Pennsylvania) to the Ohio Valley Pittsburgh regions of the Northeast, including the Mahoning Valley and the Hanging Rock region of Ohio and Kentucky.",3.0,3.0
"By 1880, Youngstown’s population had grown to nearly 16,000, which meant it had doubled in size over a twenty-year period.",3.11,2.89
"The town continued to prosper, driven by the flux of immigrants pouring in with the hopes of employment at the mills.",3.4,3.0
"This prosperity continued until the late 1920s, when the Great Depression hit the area hard.",2.62,2.63
"Despite the Congress of Industrial Organization’s successful efforts to establish a national steel workers’ union, the industry barely survived the Depression years.",2.7,2.7
"Finally, the outbreak of the Second World War made iron and steel important again, and Youngstown was bolstered out of its economic standstill into a fast-paced period of booming growth.",3.3,3.1
"Strikes racked the town during the forties, fifties, and sixties, and they were often long and bloody.",2.6,3.2
"In 1973, the Experimental Negotiating Agreement was signed.",3.1,3.0
"This prohibited strikes and lockout, angering workers and driving productivity and laborer morale down.",2.44,3.11
"At the same time, stricter governmental standards for environmental protection and the growth of imported steel were making it harder to produce and market American steel parts, and the overeager shareholders in the companies’ stock were pushing for more and more of their share of the pie.",3.1,2.8
"Most importantly, Youngstown’s steel mills were slowly becoming less efficient and more expensive.",2.6,2.7
"September 19, 1977 is a date that few people in Youngstown, Ohio will ever forget.",3.0,2.87
"Old technology was not replaced, obsolete methods were not updated, and almost none of the industry’s profits were being utilized to help modernize.",2.8,2.9
Black Monday and the Crash of the Steel Industry,2.7,2.9
"The announcement of the closing of the mills in 1977 was the beginning of a downward spiral, which would send the entire valley into chaos and ruin.",2.6,3.0
"Between 1977 and 1981, a total of five mills were closed and approximately 25,000 jobs were lost countywide.",2.4,3.2
Meetings of union officials and mill bosses were hurriedly set up in an attempt to persuade the powers that be to reconsider their statement.,3.0,3.17
"However, it was clear that, in the words of USWA president Lloyd McBride, “If you can’t make a buck, you get out of the business.”",3.0,3.3
"On that date Jennings Lambeth, president of Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company, announced that most of the steel company’s Campbell Works would close.",2.2,3.4
"“If you can’t make a buck, you get out of the business.”",2.75,3.12
"The closings meant the end of Youngstown’s only real industry, the end of its population growth, and then end of economic progress.",2.75,3.0
"Without the mills, people sought other places of employment in adjoining states or even other areas of the country.",2.8,2.9
Those that could afford to move did so; those that couldn’t afford to move mostly ended up on the streets.,2.67,3.22
"Without an industrial or a residential base, commerce shrank considerably.",2.33,3.0
"It was becoming increasingly clear that without the industrial base provided by the mills, the city of Youngstown would soon become a ghost town, inhabited by those too poor or hopeful to escape.",2.4,2.9
"The workers decided they needed to do something to save their city, and so they mobilized in a variety of ways.",3.22,3.44
Attempts to Save the Mills,3.0,2.9
"The very first thing that the workers could do was “to get up a petition to stop the shutdown,” says Ed Mann, a local union leader and organizer.",2.9,2.7
"“to get up a petition to stop the shutdown,”",3.1,3.2
"The petition was circulated, eventually including thousands of signatures; it was then given to USWA representatives to present to President Carter in Washington.",3.2,3.2
"However, the representatives were shunted to the side and ignored in Washington, since Youngstown’s political influence had died with its industry.",2.86,2.86
"The International chapter of the USWA had much more lobbying power, but they refused to support the local union members.",2.86,3.0
The petition was lost among paperwork and bureaucratic procedure.,2.5,2.8
"Next, workers decided to form the Ecumenical Coalition, an organization of local religious groups which spearheaded the attempt to reopen the Youngstown works.",3.14,3.0
The Coalition drafter letters to the Lykes Company asking if a group of workers might purchase the mill and run it collectively.,3.12,3.25
"Although for other cities this would simply be a minor economic setback, for the people of Youngstown and the surrounding area, it meant disaster.",2.43,3.43
"Lykes ignored the letters, so the Coalition turned once again to the federal government.",2.75,2.75
"Here, too, they were ignored.",2.2,2.9
"The Coalition had no proper funds to buy the mills, so they could do nothing but sit back and watch as the mills closed.",2.7,3.0
"Finally, following the shutdown of US Steel’s plant in 1980, local union leaders congregated outside the US Steel Headquarters in Youngstown.",2.9,3.2
"They invited local people and politicians to witness the scene, then charged the Headquarters and took it over.",3.1,2.9
"The workers stayed there until the next day, when US Steel declared that they were ready to talk about selling the mill.",2.78,3.0
"Immediately after the workers left the building, US steel representatives told the local union leaders that they had changed their minds and were no longer interested in allowing the workers to purchase the mill.",2.63,3.0
"All these efforts eventually came to nothing, and Youngstown’s steel mills remained closed.",2.25,2.88
"These attempts to save the mills were hindered by several major factors, including the decline of the world steel market, which made American steel impossible to sell or export.",2.75,2.88
The Decline of the World Market,2.1,3.3
The efforts to save the mills failed partly because the international market for steel had largely dried up.,2.6,2.9
"In fact, American steel imports were beginning to outweigh exports.",2.86,3.14
"Foreign steel was easier and more efficient to make, and was often of higher quality than domestic steel.",3.1,3.0
"Mahoning County was a one-industry area, and the people of Youngstown, Struthers, Campbell, Boardman Township, and the numerous other small towns and villages in the area only had one main employer: the steel mills.",3.0,3.0
"Foreign steel companies invested in their factories, updating their technology and replacing their equipment often.",3.1,3.0
"This meant that foreign facilities were more modern and efficient than any plants in America, and therefore were able to export a more competitive product.",2.78,3.0
Foreign steel was also much cheaper.,3.0,2.88
"Wage hikes, although they helped to improve living conditions of steel workers in the US, made American steel far more expensive.",2.56,2.89
"You can mix them with a 30/30/40 mix of potting soil, worm casings and clay.",3.0,2.7
Or you could go out to the shed and grab a few handfuls of that sod mix you got at that estate sale last year and get to mixing.,3.1,3.2
NOTE: Cover your work area.,3.0,2.6
Dust can fly into your mouth and eyes very easily.,2.7,2.9
"If the fertilizer in the mix is what I think it is, that wouldn't be pretty.",2.5,2.8
Use gloves to break up the soil with your fingers.,3.1,2.9
3. Make bombs.,2.7,3.0
Form the mix into balls of any size from sling-shot-pellet up to softball.,3.0,2.8
You're going to be throwing them.,3.0,3.12
Customize it yourself.,3.1,3.0
"Mine were more or less matzoh-ball size and shape, out of habit.",3.0,3.0
This worked out pretty well.,3.67,3.5
"Allow to dry overnight, or until they're solid enough for the next step.",3.1,2.9
4. Throw.,3.0,2.9
"Today, I kept it simple.",3.3,2.9
"I chose one abandoned property a few minutes from downtown, and two vacant lots.",3.08,2.83
The leftovers went onto the jungles alongside the freeway offramps.,2.9,2.9
First lesson learned -- you need at least two people to seedbomb from a vehicle .,2.89,3.0
The first responsibility should be driving safely.,3.0,3.0
"I found this hard to do while also avoiding cops, dealing with the camera and the car window, scoping out angles of approach for throwing, etc.",2.3,3.2
"Seedbombing combines elements of childhood disgruntled mudbomb-hurling; the balance of meticulousness and zen that good gardeners possess; and my own forte, the invisibility and vigilance of a sniper.",3.0,3.1
I ended up with a broken fingernail and dirt all over my lap.,2.11,3.22
"Also, a perfect strike.",3.6,3.3
But you'll have to take my word because a camera at that moment would have been crazy.,3.0,2.89
Second Lesson -- keep the seedbombs in a shallow covered container .,3.0,2.6
You want both tidiness and easy access.,3.0,3.0
"Plus, those things are crumbly.",2.8,3.1
I made eight; the last two were totally pulverized after being jostled in a paper bag for half an hour.,2.86,3.0

Dear Ms. LastName,3.12,3.0
"Over the past year, the Graduate School of Arts and Science has seen record level contributions from its alumni and alumnae to the School’s Annual Fund.",3.6,3.3
"This response is a marvelous endorsement of the work of our students, faculty, and staff.",3.6,3.3
"As you read the enclosed Dean 's Report and Request, I hope you will consider how your support of the Graduate School’s Annual Fund shapes the lives of its faculty and students as it makes an impact on the depth and breadth of their NYU experience.",3.4,3.1
"However, it reflects on a greater level both the desire of many Mayans to assimilate, as they still feel that is necessary for social mobility, and a belief among the general population that Mayans do not require a separate bill of rights as they are covered under the general rights already in the constitution (Warren 2002: 159, 172).",3.0,2.6
Illiteracy rates are in fact correlated with the Mayan language itself: those who speak Spanish are more likely to be literate than those who speak Mayan alone (England 2003: 733).,2.9,3.0
"Therefore when considering the indigenous revitalization movements which began in 20th century Latin America, the impact of those indigenous languages on those movements and the nature of the identity of the peoples themselves is key.",3.1,3.1
"Nonetheless, in 2003 the legislature passed the law of national languages, which while reaffirming Spanish as the official language, recognizes the importance of indigenous languages as part of national identity and encourages their active promotion.",3.0,3.0
This question of identity as defined by language manifests differently in Guatemala and Colombia.,3.0,3.0
"Within the pan-Mayan movement, there remains a desire to maintain linguistic diversity: some view the reduction of their language to the status of ""dialect"" devalues their unique identity and place in the Mayan world; however, despite differences over standardization, the pan-Mayan movement itself is largely cohesive.",3.0,3.0
"In contrast, Colombian indigenous groups are divided to the extent that linguistic diversity is not only valued, but serves to split the population, both between groups and within groups themselves.",3.0,2.9
"An example is the Tukanoans: while considered a single “ethnic group”, they maintain 16 distinct language groups and practice linguistic exogamy, in which members of one language group must marry into another (Jackson 1995: 4).",3.2,3.1
Language further works to establish identity by encapsulating a worldview markedly removed from that of the dominant Western culture.,3.1,3.0
"Indigenous cosmology, or “cosmovision”, is difficult to translate into Romanticized languages; it maintains a concept of culture, defined as “the form of behavior resulting from a permanent harmonic relationship with Nature” (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 58) and view of history as cyclic that is often at odds with Western modes of thought.",2.9,2.7
"Conflict between cultures arise as cosmovision is rediscovered and developed, often by native shamans in tandem with indigenous leaders aided by outside researchers and non-governmental organizations.",3.0,2.86
The differences between Western and native perceptions then lead to conflict within the revitalization movements themselves: the question of embracing Western law and discourse is continually grappled with.,2.9,2.9
"Language plays a complex and integral role in the development and redefinition of an identity, particularly when that identity has been oppressed and subsumed by a dominant other for as long as that of the indigenous peoples in Latin America has. In particular I will examine two divergent yet remarkably parallel cases, that of the Maya in Guatemala and the Nasa and Guambiano peoples of Colombia.",3.11,3.33
"Customary law in Colombia contrasts with Western law as it maintains a different perception of casual relationships: tying back to the indigenous concept of harmony, crimes are viewed as imbalances in the community's harmony and can often be traced back to those who did not perpetuate the crime, but may have influenced the accused to do so.",2.7,3.0
Indigenous Revitalization Movements of Latin America: The Rediscovery of Language and Identity,3.1,2.9
"When a punishment - often public and corporal in nature - is carried out, the group feels the effects as a whole.",2.57,3.0
"Shamans often sit with the criminal as he fills his sentence, sharing in their ordeal.",3.0,2.91
"(Rappaport 2005) Once punishments are completed, the criminal is seen as rehabilitated, having fulfilled his duty to restore harmonic order, and is welcomed back into the community (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 61, Rappaport 2005: 97).",3.0,2.9
"Translation of law into native languages has proved to be a difficult task, as Western ideas often have no parallel in indigenous cosmovision.",2.9,2.9
"The translation of the Colombian constitution sparked the development of neologisms, as the goal of the translators was not to provide a direct translation of the constitution, but to recapture its spirit in a native, rather than Western discourse (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 58-59).",3.2,3.0
"This provides a second interpretation of law distinct from that of the Spanish Colombian culture, and in turn an interpretation aligned with native ideology for the cabildos to follow when governing (Rappaport 2005: 93, 236).",2.9,2.8
"Translation fulfills another vital role, as it is employed in the rediscovery of the indigenous identity itself.",3.25,2.87
"Workshops and advocacy groups regularly work to translate native histories back into native forms of knowledge, distancing them from the Western influences that have invaded over the past six centuries.",2.88,2.75
The Guambiano history project charts native history as the outward spiraling events which are both cyclic and parallel in nature; Mayan historians translate and document oral histories whose legacy is in danger of being forgotten (Rappaport 2005: 165).,2.9,2.8
This attempt to regain identity via translation is indicative of the intimate relationship between indigenous revitalization within a modern context and native language use.,2.9,2.5
"Difficulties arise, however, as conflicts between the traditional and modern and native languages and Spanish develop.",2.8,2.9
"Many native peoples in Colombia are monolingual Spanish speakers, raising the question of the practicality of indigenous language use.",2.9,3.1
"The differences between cosmovision in Spanish and indigenous languages are great, leading to the difficulty of governing in Spanish yet embracing indigenous mode of thought.",3.0,3.0
"In addition, there exists a complex relationship between what are perceived as different levels of indigenous identity; the Nasa, for example, divide themselves into the traditional, modern, and new.",3.0,2.78
"The authenticity of the modern Nasa, who are often metropolitan Spanish speakers attempting to reconnect with their roots, is brought into question by the traditional, who speak Nasa Yuwe and lead a rural existence(Rappaport 2005).",2.8,2.7
"In Guatemala the fact remains that Spanish is the gateway to social mobility; years of conflict and refugee status have established the desire to leave a rural way of life for an updated urban one, and those literate in Spanish have the tools to do so.",3.1,3.1
"Illiteracy and poverty is associated with Maya; thus there is the conflict between the desire to recapture the unique Mayan identity via the language and the need to improve living conditions, which most often occurs under Spanish influence.",2.89,3.0
"A further complication is the necessity of establishing authentic “Indianness”, both in the eyes of fellow indigenous peoples and the outside Spanish culture.",2.9,2.8
"The ONIC of Colombia lacks legitimacy precisely because it is perceived as not “Indian enough”; it embraces the use of Spanish and Western discourse, leading to distrust among indigenous peoples (Jackson 2002: 85).",2.7,3.1
"Their struggle to attain status in societies still bearing the marks of Spanish colonialism is deeply tied to their struggle to reaffirm the nature of their “indigenous identity”, and is in turn linked to the interaction of Spanish and their native languages.",3.0,3.1
"Politicians make a point of appearing in their native dress and speaking in their native language in assembly, even if they are more at home in a business suit and speaking Spanish; indigenous identity has become a calling card to the extent that at times it appears to be a caricature of itself.",2.9,2.9
The Colombian constitution is problematic in that it provides little guide as to what exactly forms an indigenous group; the concept of culture is so complex and divergent that establishing self-determination in the eyes of the Colombian government requires emphasizing differences.,3.0,2.88
"Efforts towards development, then, cannot endanger traditional culture and values, for fear of losing cultural legitimacy (Jackson 1995: 5).",3.0,2.7
"There develops a duality in native culture; for example, many Nasa children receive instruction in Nasa Yuwe yet converse in Spanish outside the classroom.",3.1,2.8
"An emphasis on preserving, rather than practicing, native culture arises: indigenous authenticity is maintained by sustaining knowledge of traditional practices and beliefs without fully embracing them on a day-to-day basis (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 66-67).",3.0,3.0
This intersection of language and indigenous identity poses challenges which have yet to be fully addressed.,2.9,2.6
"In Guatemala, they are largely comprised of the conflict between poverty and progress; the pan-Mayan movement must meet the dual trials of establishing a positive identity within the Mayan population itself and legitimacy in the legal and political arenas in order to gain policy reforms and codified rights in law.",2.9,3.1
"In Colombia, legal successes have often come about due to the Colombian government's recognition of the political viability of the rhetoric of indigenous rights; by granting indigenous peoples judicial sovereignty they hope to win the trust of a people who view the government as incapable of protecting them from the ongoing civil strife, and by giving them blocks of land they hope that the indigenous community will be able to keep out drug traffickers and guerrillas where the government itself has not (Jackson 1995: 8).",3.0,3.0
"Regardless of the ulterior motives behind their legal status, indigenous peoples in Colombia now possess the rights to teach and govern in their own languages according to their own laws (Jackson 1995: 5).",3.0,2.88
Conflicts arise due to internal differences and the ever-persist problem of defining indigenous identity and authenticity in a pluralistic linguistic environment.,2.8,3.0
Works Cited,2.9,2.9
The effects of Spanish colonialism are both far-reaching and deeply embedded in both countries.,2.86,2.86
"One of the most prominent, lasting influences is that of the land grant system. Initially the Spanish government attempted to instate the encomienda system, in which a conquistador maintained direct control over the indigenous peoples and their land.",2.9,2.7
"This was in turn replaced by the repartimento; the natives were allowed to maintain control over their land and their laws but remained in every way the inferior of the Spanish, providing labor and taxes as demanded.",2.9,3.2
"Humans, in the process of defining themselves, look to immediately recognizable factors in order to differentiate themselves from others.",2.89,3.22
"In reality land ownership rights were the exclusive right of the Spanish, resulting in modern-day malappropriation of land ownership in the hands of the descendants of the Spanish colonialists (Warren 1978, 7-8). Indigenous peoples are commonly sharecroppers or migrant workers.",2.8,2.9
The impoverished plight of the native populations was first recognized by the Marxist movements of the early 20th century.,3.29,3.14
"Those were the first to articulate the necessity of affirming the independent identity of the indigenous populations; previously, both the left and right maintained a belief in indigenous assimilation into the dominant Spanish culture.",3.1,3.0
"However, they also claimed that they were part of a larger group, the working class, whose poverty was a direct result of American imperialism; therefore they should join these new popular leftist movements in order to reorganize society into a worker-friendly one (Jackson 1995: 6-7).",3.11,3.22
In Colombia this resulted in a civil war between the Liberal and Communist parties and Conservative party.,2.4,2.9
"A truce established between the Liberals and Conservatives failed to meet the demands of the Communists, who in turn sustained guerrilla attacks in response.",2.4,3.2
"Guerrilla warfare has since become a part of Colombian life; multiple groups maintain an ongoing presence, often stationing themselves in the remote mountainous villages often populated by various indigenous peoples.",2.4,3.0
"This process leads to the development of what can be broadly termed culture: a group of people joined by characteristics, traits, and beliefs comes to view themselves as sharing a distinct identity, discernible from that of those “outside” them, those who do not belong.",3.09,2.91
"This is similar to the situation of Guatemala: the government felt it needed to battle communism, an “armed and dangerous menace within”, plunging the country into civil warfare in the 1960s and continuing through the 1980s (Warren 1993: 25).",2.9,3.0
"This resulted in persecution against the Mayans, who make up about 60% of the overall population. In both counties, guerrillas were often associated with the native peoples; in many cases there were coalitions, but in others the guerrillas merely used the remote, inaccessible villages as hideouts.",2.6,3.1
"In Guatemala over 450 villages were destroyed, 200,000 Mayans were killed, and over 1 million more were displaced.",2.2,3.1

The growth in popularity and militarism of these popular leftist movements is intertwined with the development of the indigenous revitalization movements.,2.8,3.1
"By the 1970s the need to assert a cause separate from the general left was seen, and indigenous rights movements formed (Warren 2003: 174, Jackson 2002: 82).",2.9,2.8
Central to these was the question of indigenous identity:,3.0,2.8
"Pan-Mayanism in particular has sought to organize itself around the Mayan language; despite local dialectical differences, it is seen as the unifying force behind the diverse Mayan people.",3.1,2.9
"Most still speak it in various forms, and efforts by Mayan linguists to standardize the language are producing a coherent, modern version of Maya (England 2003: 733, 739).",3.1,3.1
"Pan-Mayanism has succeeded in part due to its focus on issues of ethnicity; it largely avoids specifically political overtones, instead concentrating on the development of the reemerging Mayan culture (England 2003: 734).",3.0,2.6
"The popular left, however, continues to see the rhetoric of ethnic rights as a politically viable tool.",2.62,2.75
It therefore often invokes the banner of indigenous rights in its own discourse .,2.91,2.73
"The Pan-Mayan movement thus benefits from the lasting influence of the popular left on Guatemalan governmental policies without risking drawing the (often negative) attention of the government (England 2003: 735, Warren 2003: 181).",2.9,3.3
"A main concern among pan-Mayanists is the reversal of the long-seated inferiority complex of the Mayan people; despite their position as majority within the Guatemalan population, they remain impoverished and marginalized on the fridge of society.",2.86,3.0
"Naturally this can be signaled by any number of things - clothing, food, lifestyle choices.",3.0,3.0
"This results in part from the ingrained influences of Spanish colonialism: Spanish continues to be associated with modernity and social mobility, whereas Maya is seen as backward and inferior.",2.9,2.9
"Pan-Mayan leaders therefore seek to develop a return to Maya as it was in its classical renaissance, a language of power and prestige (England 2003: 736).",3.0,2.83
By doing so they hope to inculcate among the Mayan peoples a renewed sense of pride which will in turn reverse the dogma of Spanish superiority.,3.0,2.9
"Colombia, in contrast, has no unified ""pan-Indian"" sentiments; the indigenous population is a small fraction of the overall population, a fractured entity divided by region and language.",3.0,2.5
"Several competing and oftentimes conflicting indigenous rights advocacy groups have developed: the ONIC poses itself as the sole pan-Indian group, yet lacks legitimacy in the eyes of many indigenous peoples (Jackson 2002: 83, 85).",3.0,2.8
One of the most dominant and easily noted factors is language.,3.0,3.0
"The CRIC, which focuses on language development and renewal, is primarily representative of the Nasa peoples (Jackson 2003: 82).",3.0,2.62
"It often stands in conflict with the AICO, its Guambiano counterpart (Jackson 2003: 83-84).",2.75,2.88
"Whereas the Mayanists benefit from a single main identity, those of Colombia must operate under historical differences between the various ethnic groups (Jackson 2002: 109).",3.0,3.0
The Nasa and Guambiano have stood in opposition since pre-colonial times; therefore any coalition between the two advocacy groups is tenuous at best (Rappaport 2005: 2).,3.0,3.0
"This reflects a desire among the peoples themselves to maintain distinct ethnic identities, both from the Spanish Colombian population and each other.",3.3,3.0
"The command of a language, while not affording guaranteed access to the community which speaks it, is often the key to gaining entry.",3.12,2.38
"In the 1990s the rhetoric of ""cultural diversity"" was picked up the Colombian media, and subsequently entered the consciousness of the greater metropolitan public, thereby cementing its place in Colombian society as necessity and further complicating the role of indigenous movements in gaining rights for indigenous peoples as a whole.",2.7,3.1
"A major success in the Colombian saga is the revamped constitution of 1991, which includes a section on indigenous rights, as the Congress which drafted it included representatives from native groups (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 57).",3.12,2.75
Central is a return to the old land grant system stemming from the repartimentos of the colonial era along with judicial sovereignty.,2.9,2.6
"While the repartimento was originally used to repress the indigenous groups, it is now used to support them: resguardos, or communally owned plots of land, are granted to communities.",3.5,3.25
"They are ruled by the cabildo, local governing boards formed of community leaders (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 51-52).",3.0,2.6
The return to customary law reflects a substantial shift in indigenous identity:,3.0,3.0
"no longer ruled by Western laws and discourse, communities are forced to assess the efficacy of their old judicial systems in light of the modern era.",3.1,2.9
In turn communal identity can be formed around a language; it is used as the focal point around which the group gathers.,3.1,3.1
"The oral nature of jurisprudence directly conflicts with the desire of the Colombian government to codify law, and questions of human rights violations are common as punishments are often corporal in nature (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 57-58).",3.0,2.6
The Colombian constitution stands in stark contrast to the failure of the Guatemalan indigenous rights referendum of 1999.,2.6,3.2
Mayans gained formal recognition in 1995 as the majority population in a precursor to the 1996 peace accord; by 1999 its government floated a referendum on an indigenous bill of rights resembling that codified in the Colombian constitution (Warren 2002: 157-158).,3.27,2.64

"As a person who cares about animals, you’re probably anxious to know what happened to Astro.",2.75,3.0
A neighbor reported Astro’s plight to the ASPCA and our Humane Law Enforcement officers went to investigate.,2.71,3.0
"When our officers arrived, Astro was too weak to even stand up.",2.63,3.0
"The officers knelt down slowly, speaking gently to the emaciated dog.",2.67,2.78
Then they saw it.,3.1,3.3
Astro was wagging his tail.,3.78,3.56
He was barely moving.,2.6,2.7
"but yes -- the poor, sick dog was saying.",2.38,3.0
"“Welcome, friends!”",3.8,3.8
The officers brought Astro to the ASPCA’s Bergh Memorial Animal Hospital.,2.8,3.2
The dog weighted only 45 pounds -- less than half of what a dog his size should weigh -- and he had several infections.,2.11,3.11
"But with first-rate medical attention and tender care from ASPCA staff, he slowly got well again.",3.7,3.3
Stories like Astro’s are all too common.,3.0,2.7

Just imagine finding your favorite hiking trail or birding area littered with dead birds -- among the hundreds of thousands of unsuspecting and innocent creatures who were unlucky enough to consume lethal doses of a slow-acting poison spread in fields miles away.,2.14,3.57
"You see, the USDA found a loophole allowing these protections to be lifted for “experimental” activities.",2.82,3.0
So they applied for the right to spread poison as Dart of a “scientific experiment” -- to learn whether lowering the population of blackbirds by poisoning them will reduce sunflower crop loss.,2.9,2.7

The USDA wants to conduct an “experiment” that will spread enough poison in our environment to kill two million blackbirds.,2.4,3.2

"A good decision: I didn't return all chill and zen, as one friend told me his roommate had, but I certainly gained a few new ideas and approaches to mull over, and dipped my hand into a previously unfamiliar piece of the world.",3.1,3.3
They suggested that what you believe about self-control affects the goals you set and achieve [PDF].,3.0,2.9
I'm not one to make New Year's resolutions.,3.0,2.7
"In the paper, ""self-control"" is used to mean a sense of willpower.",3.0,2.8
"""self-control""",2.9,2.9
"Mukhopadhyay & Venkatarmani discuss various lay theories of self-control, noting that the amount of self-control a person has can be seen as either an inherently limited or unlimited resource, and that this resource can be seen either as malleable or as fixed (the amount of self-control a person has can change over time, or not).",3.0,2.9
"I mean, sure, I could take my pick of popular New Year's resolutions ; I could decide, on the first day of the new year, that this year, I'll start exercising more and eating better, or that I'll spend more time with my family and friends, or that I'll learn a new skill.",3.1,3.3
An important premise to note here is the idea that the probability of choosing a goal or making a resolution increases if a person thinks that goal can be attained.,3.1,3.3
"So if you think you'll be able to achieve a goal, you're more likely to set it.",3.3,2.9
"Combine this with theories of self-control, and in general, if you believe you have unlimited stores of self-control, you'll set a larger number of goals.",3.1,3.2
"If you believe self-control is malleable but limited, you'll set fewer goals.",2.73,2.73
"Mukhopadhyay & Venkatarmani also discuss self-efficacy: belief in one's capabilities, the perceived ability to carry out a desired action.",3.0,3.0
"They propose that people with high self-efficacy--people who believe that failure is the result of insufficient effort, and thus exhibit increased commitment and persistence--will achieve more of their goals than people with low self-efficacy, who tend to view failure as the result of deficient ability, and thus may simply give up.",3.0,3.1
"Self-control, Self-efficacy, and New Year's Resolutions Unresolved",2.9,3.0
The studies,3.0,2.8
"In the first study, 85 participants (all college students) each read one of four passages presenting lay theories of self-control.",3.0,2.7
"Each passage contained two paragraphs; the first discussed self-control either as limited or as unlimited, and the second discussed self-control as either malleable or fixed.",3.1,3.1
"The participants then answered questions about their belief in each of two theories presented, followed by a second questionnaire to assess motivation, in which they listed all their current goals.",3.1,2.8
"The study was testing whether a belief in unlimited, malleable self-control would result in most resolutions, and indeed, this is what was found.",3.0,2.8
"The experimenters had some concerns about participants' natural beliefs in relation to the passages they read, however, so in study two, the order of the two measures (lay theories and motivation/goal listing) was varied.",2.9,2.9
"Data from 130 new participants revealed that, as hypothesized, if the motivation & goals questionnaire were assessed first, then among the people who believed self-control is malleable, those who also believed self-control to be unlimited (vs.",3.0,3.0
limited) set more goals.,3.0,3.0
"When lay theories were assessed first, this result reversed.",3.0,2.9
The people who believed that self-control is fixed were unaffected by order.,3.0,3.1
"The third study moved on to examine goal achievement, adding a measure to look at self-efficacy.",3.1,3.0
"The study had two sessions, in November then February.",3.0,2.6
"In the first session , the 159 participants read passages about lay theories (much like in study one, but with longer passages to strengthen the manipulation), listed the resolutions they were planning on making at New Years, rated how disappointed they would be if they failed to keep their resolutions, and filled out individual difference measures (which included a self-efficacy scale).",2.9,2.9
"And if I chose to make resolutions, I'd be far from alone--a 2008 survey on Dorthy.com found that 66% of the 2000+ adults polled had made resolutions at some point (though only 17% managed to keep them).",2.9,2.9
"Only 86 participants successfully returned for the second session, during which they indicated how much success they had had at keeping their resolutions.",3.2,3.0
What does this mean for your resolutions?,3.0,2.8
"The resolutions made by participants across all conditions were qualitatively similar (take a look at any list of popular New Year's resolutions, and you'll see the majority of the goals).",3.0,2.7
"As shown in the first two studies, more goals were set by people who believe self-control is unlimited and malleable than by any other people--that is, if you expect more success, you may increase the difficulty and number of tasks that you set for yourself.",3.0,2.7
Self-efficacy did not have a significant effect on goal-setting.,2.9,3.0
"As far as success goes, only the interaction between lay theory and self-efficacy was significant.",2.9,2.9
"If participants believed in limited self-control and were low in self-efficacy, they tended to give up more often, failing to achieve their goals.",2.7,2.9
"But if participants believed in unlimited self-control, self-efficacy had no effect; participants achieved just as many goals regardless, and people who set more resolutions were marginally more likely to succeed.",3.09,2.64
"Mukhopadhyay & Venkatarmani realize that their research does not directly look at the relationship between lay theories of self-control and beliefs about one's own amount of self-control and self-efficacy, and propose this as an area for future study.",3.0,3.0
"But in general, lay theories about self-control can determine how much success you'll expect (and thus, how many goals you'll set), and self-efficacy beliefs can determine how much success you'll actually have.",3.1,3.3

"Something whined as it spun past Chad's ear, and he heard a sharp, meaty thunk just behind him.",2.9,3.2
"The rock was too big to fit into the iron hub of the big cable spool, so Chad leaned it against the tumbleweed and slid down off the splintery wood on his belly to admire his handiwork.",3.36,2.91

Roy stood expressionless as ever as Chad turned to look.,3.0,2.88
"Tucker towered there with a surprised expression and crossed eyes, the tumbleweed in one hand and the screwdriver held up high in the other ready to stab down into Chad's back.",3.0,3.29

Who was Tasha Cortez?,3.0,3.14
She was a twenty-four-year-old (Terran Standard) N'Apulcan who left university training in hydroponics to work for her aunt's real estate firm.,3.0,2.9
"Her family said she did it to support her father, who was dying of a particularly painful degenerative disease.",2.37,3.12

She did not like my plays.,2.3,2.7

"That bothered (yes, and intrigued) me until I realized that she was bored by most plays, movies, and vid.",2.8,3.3
She did not like being a spectator.,2.6,2.9
I often told her that she should have a bio-check to see if she suffered from some metabolic imbalance.,3.0,3.0
I often told her too many things.,2.7,2.9
"Search ""Emiliano Malaquez"" and you'll find he's a master of the ""captured moment"" school of sculpture.",3.1,2.8
Even The Terran Times has only praise for his work.,3.37,3.0
"When my father died, a year after my mother, my sisters and I cleaned out their apartment.",2.0,2.78
To compare his pieces to those of others is to compare mannequins to living models.,3.0,2.7
"He accents the illusion of reality --I paraphrase his entry in La Enciclopedia Humanica --by doing life-size scenes in ""the full round,"" never the easier frontal or three-quarters view.",2.86,3.14
"Moreover, he never did portraits of famous people; his works were therefore the reality and could never be compared to it.",3.0,2.8
"As is typical of his school, his pieces are sealed in stopboxes.",2.9,2.7
The shimmer of light on their surfaces always reminds us that we're looking at an instant snatched from under the hooves of time.,3.0,3.1
"They say the cubes will outlast planets and suns, that when the universe dies, the works of Malaquez and his followers will be the last things seen in the final wink of God's eye.",3.0,3.4
"Yes, Self, I am also bothered that this observation ignores half-eaten cheese sandwiches, incomplete insect collections, and locks of infants' hair, forgotten in closets, basements, and warehouses.",2.73,3.18
We found our baby shoes protected in stopboxes.,3.6,2.8
"You see the inspiration for my latest play, ""Captured Moments.""",3.1,3.0

I muttered something he must have interpreted as assent.,3.0,3.0
They both walked up to Emil's home while I watched the scarlet moonlight ripple on distant waves.,3.0,3.2
"Disgusted with Tasha but more disgusted with myself, I finally realized she would not return that night and went into The Sleeping Flamingo to drink myself to sleep.",2.14,3.29
She had not come home when I woke in mid-morning.,2.1,3.0
"I waited, and drank a glass of MorningAfter and three cups of coffee, and wondered whether our affair could survive the events of the night, and whether I wanted it to.",2.5,3.1
"Perhaps I should have invited Emil to stay, but even then I knew that sex was not the problem between Tasha and me.",2.7,2.8
"The problem was that I have trouble distinguishing between compromise and capitulation, between symbols and substance.",2.75,3.0
"Shortly before noon, I climbed the sandy path to Dream's End, rehearsing my apology, slowing only to pluck burrs from between my sandals and my feet.",2.6,2.9

"If that was Malaquez's work, it was a very minor effort.",2.8,3.0
"But then, I was in no mood to consider art.",2.63,2.75

Tasha lay sprawled nude on a rumpled bed.,2.9,3.6
Her skin seemed as smooth and as polished as the bed's teak frame.,3.4,2.9
"She was looking slightly to my left, smiling with trust and satisfaction like one sexually content.",3.63,3.82
"Malaquez stood near her, pointing something at my chest.",3.0,2.89
"Though the morning sun shone fully on both of them, it shimmered around Tasha.",3.5,3.1
The part of my mind that remembered four months in NorAm during the Great Cleaning sent me rolling across the floor.,2.56,3.22
"Malaquez was not prepared for me to react so quickly, or perhaps he waited too long for an expression I would not have, a gesture I would not make, a poignant moment of repentence, wonder, despair, or love.",3.0,3.2
The following events may indicate otherwise.,3.0,3.0
"Had he been faster, he could have had rage.",2.8,3.4

"I demanded, squeezing his throat until he began jerking his head madly at the sculpture.",2.3,3.6
I stared at the naked Tasha.,3.25,3.25
"Most of his story I have pieced together since, but I understood enough as I knelt on his chest with my hands tight on his fleshy throat.",2.44,3.67
"In fine tourist tradition, most homes on Vega IV are named.",3.0,2.9
He had made his name with a home capturador.,3.0,3.1
"He began with small animals and moved on to derelicts and Undersiders, people who would never be missed.",3.0,2.8
"Now he had thought to use vacationers like Tasha and me, and when someone came looking, he would say we had gone island-hopping in our windboat.",3.0,3.0
Our boat would disappear into the ocean to be found or not as the wind and tides chose.,2.6,3.0
"Mine was The Sleeping Flamingo, and its outer walls were coral pink.",3.0,2.8
His story would stand in either case.,3.0,2.8
"I wanted him to tell me more, but he babbled, begging me to forgive him, to understand.",2.8,3.2
I did not listen.,2.33,3.17
"I think I was wondering what it meant to say that a thing was art, so we accepted it as art.",2.88,3.0
Or perhaps I was thinking about the things that humanity made that would outlive our species.,2.9,3.3
But I was probably only looking at my reflection in the capturador's lens.,3.0,2.89
"Had he said then that I should use it on myself, I might have.",2.86,3.0
That moment passed.,2.56,2.78
I looked at Malaquez.,3.1,2.9
"Were they mood-sensitive, they would have changed as I first viewed them.",3.1,3.0
His lips contorted as if they had lost their ability to shape sound.,2.8,2.8
I turned to touch the cube that was Tasha's crypt.,2.4,3.1
"She smiled in trust or pleasure or pride, an erotic Mona Lisa who would smile forever, and I could never know why.",3.44,3.11
I could free Tasha.,3.1,3.1
"If I did, one of three things would happen.",3.1,3.0
Most likely: she would be meat --there is a reason why stopboxes are most often used in kitchens.,2.9,3.1
Less likely: she would live the rest of her days with a mind as free of worry as a slug's.,3.12,3.0
"And the tiniest chance of all: she would blink as if I had just materialized in Emil's bedroom, and then she would laugh and tell me that she was going to be immortal.",3.0,3.14
"The rental agent, an attractive N'apulcan named Tasha Cortez, was not mood-sensitive either.",2.8,2.9
"As I put my hand on the impervious surface of Tasha's stopbox, I heard Malaquez run for the door.",3.0,2.8
It is strange to know that we can do acts of unrepayable kindness to those we should hate.,3.1,3.0
"Know this, my future self: Thanks to us, Emil Malaquez's name will live as long as his masterpiece, ""A Self-Portrait: Anguish,"" endures.",3.4,2.9
And Tasha?,3.0,2.9
I could say that I did not dare to take responsibility for her fate.,2.67,2.83
"I could say that I chose out of consideration for her desire for fame; some critics already say ""Waking With Tasha"" is Malaquez's finest work.",3.2,3.2
"If science finds a way to safely free the subjects of Emil's art, perhaps the I who reads this file will know that my decision is wise.",3.17,3.0
But I cannot stop thinking that I was never afraid of losing Tasha to brain damage or death.,2.2,3.3
"My fear is that she would live, and I would learn that I had lost her long before Emil Malaquez translated her into a thing that can be kept, admired, and loved.",2.6,3.6
"For in my way, I have done the same thing.",3.0,2.89

I am ready for the mindwipe now.,2.89,3.11

"But mostly, I'm wondering what will happen when I try to make those gestures, that ""device"" right here in my cell?",2.8,2.9
"Acres said it was dangerous, but maybe I could find my way back to the mound or Easter Island even.",2.8,3.3
I figure it can't be worse than the lethal injection that's waiting for me at dawn.,2.0,3.3
I stared him down until he flinched.,2.7,3.2
I don't really believe I'll make it or I wouldn't say a thing.,2.37,2.75
"But if I do make it, it won't matter what I tell you, because there won't be a jail that can hold me.",2.8,3.3
Wish me luck.,3.25,3.5
I out of here.,2.8,3.2
"As I did, I noticed just how tired he looked around the eyes.",2.78,2.78
"Charlie Boy had been working hard lately, I figured.",3.0,2.91
"I knew every cop in Fairport and quite a few of the state police in Iowa, and I couldn't see them bringing old Charles in as a ringer.",3.0,3.0
'm not a cop,2.9,3.0
"He sighed and went on in softer, sadder voice, ""I guess I'm a thief now.""",2.14,2.57
Hold it.,3.0,3.1
I looked around.,3.0,3.12
"Charles might be for real, but he was still going to get me in deep trouble.",2.57,2.72
"Let's make real clear right now that you were joking, buddy.",2.7,3.3
Otherwise this conversation is over.,2.2,3.4
"I've got a parole officer to explain things to, and he wouldn't like that kinda talk.",2.6,3.3
Right.,3.2,3.2
Right.,3.1,3.1
Sorry.,2.27,2.91
Charles looked out the window at the passing traffic push through dirty slush for awhile.,2.7,2.8
Like I was saying.,2.9,3.1
"I'm a researcher, I've come into some valuable material that I would like to find a buyer for, and I don't want to have to explain myself to anyone.",2.88,3.25
"He said he had a ""business proposition"" for me.",3.3,3.0
"The pie came and I waited until the waitress was gone, before going on, ""Why me?""",2.45,3.18
You were the first person who came to mind.,3.1,3.1
First person?,3.0,3.0
Twenty years out of high school?,2.9,3.0
How much of this 'valuable material' are we talking about?,3.0,3.0
Four Hundred ounces for a start.,3.14,3.14
Four Hundred.,3.0,2.9
I pulled out my palm phone and looked up a number.,2.9,2.9
That's alot.,3.0,2.9
He drained the last of his cup and tossed some bills on the table.,3.0,2.89
I'm staying in town.,3.1,2.8
Let me show you something.,3.0,3.3
"I thought about it and made a quick call, just telling a buddy that I was ""postponing our meeting,"" for a couple of hours, meaning he should come looking for me if I didn't show up.",2.8,3.1
"He sounded surprised and said no, he needed me to help him get rid of ""a large quantity of gold.""",3.25,3.63
"Charles might not look like much, but I hadn't made it through my life taking that kind of chance.",3.0,2.9
I put away the cell and used the motion to cover checking the knife in my sleeve and used one leg to check the other in my sock.,3.1,3.2
I had been an amateur magician for years.,3.2,3.2
One of my best tricks was pulling a knife out of thin air.,3.4,3.4
It never failed to amaze.,4.0,3.25
Sure.,2.9,2.7
"Let's go,"" I said.",3.0,3.0
We took his rental car back to the motel where he was staying.,3.0,2.75
"The little desk was covered with large books filled with sticky notes, a pile of folders and papers and a laptop computer plugged into the phone line.",3.0,3.14
"There was only one chair, so I sat on the edge of the bed as he handed me a book open to a picture of some sort of stone tablet.",2.9,2.3
"Rapa Nui,"" he said, ""Easter Island.",3.0,2.88
This codex is one of the few remaining examples of a form of writing known as 'rongorongo.,3.1,3.1
"For a long time no one was able to decipher it, although by deduction, Steven Fischer deciphered some of it in nineteen ninety four.",3.11,2.78
I told him I'd meet him for coffee at the diner down the street at seven.,3.14,3.0
"He mostly read creation stories off objects like the 'Santiago Staff' which said things like, 'All the birds copulated with fish: There issued forth the sun.",3.0,3.0
But he ignored the inscriptions on skulls and the 'Birdman' statuette.,2.8,2.9
It was those clues that started all of this.,3.0,3.3
I didn't see much money in hieroglyphic porn.,3.0,2.9
"He talked on about people with long ears who built the big statues, the ""moai"" and people with short ears who conquered the people with long ears and ate them and how the short eared people didn't really know the secrets of the long ears and had pulled down all the moai statues and destroyed some of the tablets.",2.8,3.2
I was there early.,3.2,2.8
And how the missionaries came and the converted natives had destroyed more.,2.5,3.0
"He flipped pages to another image, ""But notice something here in the arrangement of the moai.",3.1,2.8
"See here how they form a pattern, very similar to this?",2.9,2.9
He pulled out a small leather diary and opened it to a yellowed page marked with yet another small sticky note.,3.0,3.0
There was an ink drawing and writing in a tiny neat hand that I couldn't read from where I sat.,2.9,2.8
I didn't see much resemblance except maybe there were about the same number of points in the cat's cradle thing in the diary and the number of dots on the map showing places where statues stood in a thin line around the coast of the island.,3.0,2.9
"he was already there, sitting in a booth, warming his hands on a cup of coffee.",3.0,2.63
This is the diary of a mysterious explorer named Samuel Curlew who investigated a Mound Builder site in this area in the early eighteen hundreds.,3.1,3.0
He closed the little book and just about hugged it with satisfaction.,3.89,3.44
I want to show you that mound.,3.1,2.9
"You know it was these very mounds that originally sparked my interest in history, archeology and then linguistics.",3.33,3.22
And this mound is where you found gold?,3.1,3.2
"I was confused enough I let the ""G word"" slip.",2.6,3.2
Was this some crazy treasure hunt?,2.5,3.1
Or maybe this guy was just a wacko who wanted to take me out on a dark road and kill me.,2.0,3.7
"No, it's more complicated than that, but I need to show you the mound for you to understand.",2.63,3.12
He looked like jerked meat on the bone.,2.8,2.9
The drawings and the books seemed to wake him up.,3.1,3.4
He was smiling now and his eyes weren't so tired.,3.6,3.3
"I was having serious cash flow issues back then and had payments to make, so I said, ""yes,"" but my patience was running out.",2.4,2.9
"Charles Acres called me on a Thursday afternoon, just like that.",3.2,2.9
It was dark as we left.,3.0,3.0
The drive was shorter than I expected.,3.2,3.0
"He was wearing a new jacket and snow boots, but he had on a Hawaiian shirt underneath and khaki shorts of all things.",2.89,2.89
When he killed the headlights there was no light but moonlight and stars on a light dusting of snow.,2.8,2.8
"A low, black hill blocked the sky right in front of us.",2.8,2.9
"We spent the next hour stomping around the hill while he said things like, ""it was right here.""",2.8,3.0
"My patience was long gone, and I was back in the car to warming up when Acres tapped on the window and told me he had found whatever he was looking for.",2.7,3.0
We trudged back up the hill and he led me to little patch of ground with a stick poking up from it.,2.86,2.86
It looked like a bamboo walking stick.,3.0,2.7
"""This is it,"" he leaned down and motioned for me to look at something on the ground.",3.0,3.0
This is it,3.18,3.0
I casually slid a knife into my palm just in case.,2.36,2.91
"See how the lines form the pattern in the journal, the same one as the moai.",3.0,3.2
"""So you drew this?"" I asked vaguely, slow to catch on.",2.67,2.89
So you drew this?,3.0,2.9
He looked hurt and rapped on the ground with his finger.,2.14,3.29
It's stone.,3.1,3.0
Ancient.,3.1,2.9
"For the first time he looked cold and stiff in his tourist gear, making me glad I was in a suit.",3.2,3.1
"His tan was obviously deep and old, but it looked like a work tan, not the kind you get at the beach.",3.0,2.8
"Here stand beside me,"" he said.",3.1,2.9
I'm not sure if I can take you with me so I need to show you the device.,3.0,2.75
Device?,3.0,3.0
I expected him to pull out a gadget with blinking lights and was wondering which way to duck.,2.8,3.4
It's like sleight of hand.,3.1,3.0
"OK, watch and remember this.",3.14,3.14
"I'm going to do it in two parts, last part first so it won't take effect.",3.0,3.0
Remember to reverse the two parts when you actually do it.,3.0,3.14
Stunned I watched as he made several ridiculous passes with his hands paused and nodded then did a sort of sign language stutter of some sort.,2.6,3.1
"I learned this from a skull shard rongorongo, they aren't all writing language.",3.0,3.0
Some are just a memory device.,3.1,2.8
"""Mnemonic."" I muttered, which seemed to please him.",3.3,3.3
Mnemonic.,3.0,2.7
Yes.,3.2,3.2
They help in remembering steps in a ritual or ceremonial gestures.,3.0,2.44
There's a long history of Polynesian gesture and dance language.,3.3,3.1
Now you do it.,2.89,3.11
He smiled and I could see his teeth in the moonlight.,3.6,3.2
His hands were thin and huge knuckled with obvious callouses.,2.9,2.7
"I wanted to slug him, but he had the keys to the car back and I figured I'd humor him while I figured out how to get them without violating my parole.",2.1,3.5
I didn't have much trouble duplicating his hand waving even though I hadn't paid much attention.,3.11,2.89
I even swapped the two parts as he had asked.,2.9,3.1
"I thought he was surprised at my dexterity when his jaw dropped, but he shouted, ""No!"" just before everything changed.",2.5,3.6
I was standing on a perfectly flat square of dark stone.,3.1,3.1
"For as far as I could see by a weak, gray light the stone stepped up and down making little hills and terraces and platforms.",3.11,2.56
I seemed to be somewhere in the middle -- there was as much above as below.,3.1,2.8
The sky was dull and featureless and overcast.,2.3,2.5
"So, the mining business is treating you pretty good, huh Charles?",3.25,2.88
"The air smelled bad in some way I can't describe, and at my feet I could see the same design from the little journal and the mound carved into the rock.",2.38,3.0

“The captain selected us for a reason. He has inside intelligence—how else would he know where to find us? He knows about us.”,3.1,3.1
He has inside intelligence—how else would he know where to find us?,3.1,3.1
He knows about us.”,2.89,3.11

"First, the whole in-a-vacuum why's-there-a-bell thing.",3.0,2.88
"“I still like my idea,”",3.56,3.33
"“I still like my idea,” said Tiffany.",3.38,3.5
Jefferson didn't share how he found people.,2.6,3.0
"He didn't share how he knew exactly where the wrecks were, or why he saved some people but not others.",2.88,3.0
"But then again, no one asked.",3.0,2.9
"I guess we all figured, he knew what he was doing.",3.1,2.9
He had been at this savior business longer than any of us.,3.0,2.8
I wondered if Adrienne would ask about that.,2.9,3.1
"“We're going to mean something,”",3.38,3.37
"“We're going to mean something,” Zheng was saying.",3.33,2.83
"Second, I was floating in the dark remnants of my broken ship, and any conceivable light sources were not within view; starlight is a distinctly different color and significantly less bright.",2.4,3.3
"“What we do, rebelling against the oppression of the many governments that oppose us, we're going to leave a legacy.”",3.3,3.4
He sounded certain.,3.11,3.11
"Enthusiastic, even.",3.6,3.3
"Ray, he shook his head, and broke the quiet he'd held most of the evening.",2.82,3.09
“You've got it all wrong.”,2.3,3.5
"He looked from Sarah, to Adrienne, to Zheng, to Kishori and Tiffany, to me.",2.9,3.0
"“Obviously, we can't last longer than the rest of the universe.",2.7,2.9
We aren't giving anyone purpose.,2.0,2.82
We're not even going to leave a legacy.,2.33,2.89
All we're doing is existing.,3.0,3.1
"All we're doing is eating and drinking and shitting, breathing and fucking and nothing important, ever.",2.6,3.0
We aren't special.”,2.62,3.0
"“Again, bleak,”",2.2,3.4
"“Again, bleak,” commented Zheng.",2.6,3.1
Adrienne gestured for him to be quiet.,2.7,3.2
"She leaned forward, setting her elbows on the foot stool in front of her.",3.0,2.88
"“You never know when it will end,”",2.89,2.89
"“You can't hold on forever, even if you don't ever, ever want to forget.",2.57,3.14
"“You can't hold on forever, even if you don't ever, ever want to forget. How long until the memories slip away? How long until all you remember is this, the ship, the thick red carpeting, the chandeliers, the empty conversations you hold with the other shells who used to be people? When your life, the reason you lived, the people and faces and places, the emotions you felt, who and what you loved, when all that is gone, faded, what will you have left?”",2.4,3.7
How long until the memories slip away?,2.4,3.0
"How long until all you remember is this, the ship, the thick red carpeting, the chandeliers, the empty conversations you hold with the other shells who used to be people?",2.6,2.9
I wondered how long Ray had been on this ship.,3.1,3.1
"I wondered why, if he had such an unpropitious outlook, he hadn't tried to change his situation.",2.62,3.12
"I wanted to ask, but he was still talking, and I was too self-conscious to interrupt.",2.9,3.2
"“You can try to hold on,”",2.8,3.3
"“You can try to hold on,” said Ray.",2.7,3.3
“You can try and try and try.,2.9,3.0

No longer grounded.”,3.75,3.25
"Ray, he said, “If we last forever, if our eyes are the last eyes watching as the stars blink out, it won't mean a thing to us.",3.1,3.1
"“If we last forever, if our eyes are the last eyes watching as the stars blink out, it won't mean a thing to us. We won't care that we're last and we won't care that there are no more stars. We aren't angels. We're just dumb and lucky.”",3.1,2.7
We aren't angels.,2.67,3.0
We're just dumb and lucky.”,3.1,3.2
"“Pure dumb luck,”",2.7,3.2

"“Struck a nerve, huh?”",2.7,3.2
said Zheng.,2.88,2.75
"“Sorry,”",2.43,2.86
"“Sorry,” said Ray.",2.7,2.9
“How long ago was that?”,3.0,2.62
asked Adrienne.,3.0,2.38
"“Leaving your wife, I mean.",2.56,3.11
"“Leaving your wife, I mean. Traveling on this ship.”",2.89,2.67
The first words they said to me meant nothing.,2.7,2.9

"“I don't know,”",2.5,3.1
"“I don't know,” he said.",2.86,2.71
We were all quiet for a moment.,2.73,2.55
"Ray shrugged, then got up and left.",2.6,2.8
We let him go.,3.2,2.8
Silent.,2.9,2.2
Self-conscious.,2.6,2.6
"More excuses were made, and after a few moments, only Adrienne and I were left sitting in the ballroom.",2.72,3.28
She looked across the circle of couches at me.,3.0,3.12
“What's your theory?”,3.25,3.0
she asked me.,3.1,3.1
I shrugged.,2.5,3.0
“How long have you been here?”,3.0,2.9
I wasn't listening; I didn't care; I was going to live; I was going to keep breathing.,3.2,3.2
"“Not that long,”",3.0,3.12
"“Not that long,” I said.",3.0,3.1
"“A couple weeks, I guess.",3.0,3.0
"“A couple weeks, I guess. Maybe a month or two.”",3.0,2.9
Maybe a month or two.”,2.9,2.7
“Why don't you know for sure?”,2.67,3.22
she asked.,3.0,2.88
I shrugged.,2.9,3.0
I hadn't been counting days.,2.9,2.9
“What did you do before this?,3.0,2.9
“What did you do before this? How were you found?”,3.0,3.0
How were you found?”,3.2,3.3
“I was an engineer.”,3.09,2.73
"I explained how my ship had malfunctioned, no warning at all.",2.88,3.0
"The explosions, the impossible rescue.",2.7,3.2
She nodded.,3.14,2.86
"“The ship I was on, I guess that's what happened, too.",3.0,3.0
"“The ship I was on, I guess that's what happened, too. Some vital part broke, and... well, boom. It was all so fast.”",2.8,3.3

It was all so fast.”,3.0,3.37
"She took a sip of her drink, plain water because, she had explained earlier, she had never liked the taste of alcohol, then fixed her gaze on me.",3.0,2.9

"I paced my room that night, unable to sleep.",2.1,3.4
"The more I thought about it, the less sense the ship made.",3.0,3.0
"Next to those, nothing else mattered.",2.82,2.82
"Worse, Adrienne had made this clear to me with a single question.",2.7,3.0
"I had spent weeks asking nothing, contentedly getting nowhere.",3.0,3.0
Fact: Adrienne intimidated me.,2.0,3.67
Fact: It's too easy to fall into patterns.,2.9,2.7
I resolved to break the pattern.,3.14,3.0
"Another evening, another chandeliered room, another swirl of conversations and dances and hor d'oevres.",3.3,3.3
"Another circle of chairs and couches, another uncomfortable question.",2.71,2.86
"The recycled air tasted sweet in my mouth, and all thoughts that crossed my mind were cheap metaphors about life-giving substances and how breathing was like sex, only better.",3.7,3.5
“Has anyone ever left?”,3.0,3.0
Adrienne looked at each of us in turn.,3.0,3.27
Ray exchanged a glance with Zheng.,3.0,3.0
Sarah frowned.,2.6,3.0
"“Now that you mention it, I haven't seen Alexis in days.",2.3,2.8
"“Now that you mention it, I haven't seen Alexis in days. I assumed he was indisposed.”",2.75,3.0
I assumed he was indisposed.”,2.88,2.75
Kishori nodded in agreement.,3.18,2.73
"After the first whoosh of the air being sucked away, there was lightning, but no thunder.",2.9,3.2
I looked at Ray and raised an eyebrow.,2.9,3.1
“What?”,2.88,3.13
"“Well,”",3.0,3.12
"“Well,” Ray said, slowly, “People do leave.",2.6,2.9
“People do leave. The approximate number of people at any given event is always the same. But we see new faces.”,2.82,2.82
The approximate number of people at any given event is always the same.,3.0,2.67
Fact: Sound is a vibration.,2.9,2.9
“You're sure it's not just some people being indisposed ? ”,2.8,2.8
"asked Adrienne, using Sarah's phrasing.",3.0,2.6
Zheng shook his head and picked up a handful of candied pecans from a little dish on the end table.,2.9,3.1
"“Keep adding people long enough, regardless, you get more overall.",2.86,2.71
"“Keep adding people long enough, regardless, you get more overall. A couple people staying in their rooms, even if you switch out the people, won't make a difference.”",3.0,3.2
"A couple people staying in their rooms, even if you switch out the people, won't make a difference.”",2.8,2.9
"He dropped the pecans back into the dish, one by one.",3.0,2.6
“So where do they go?”,3.0,2.8
Adrienne focused on Zheng.,2.88,2.75
I cut in.,2.86,3.0
"“Maybe a better question is, does anyone ever come back?”",3.0,3.0
Ray and Zheng exchanged another glance.,3.1,3.0
Kishori chewed her lip.,3.0,3.17
Sarah shrugged and sipped at her drink.,2.8,2.9
"After a moment, Ray said, “I don't think so.”",2.75,3.0
“I don't think so.”,2.7,3.1
“Are there patterns?”,3.0,3.14
Adrienne asked.,3.0,2.55
“Who leaves?”,2.9,3.1
"Again, there was an uncomfortable moment of silence.",2.36,2.91
I hazarded a guess.,3.0,3.0
"“You don't notice, do you.”",2.8,3.2
Sarah looked indignant.,2.6,3.2
“Of course we notice.,3.0,3.4
"“Of course we notice. But... well, no one important ever disappears, so it doesn't really matter, does it.”",2.8,3.2
"But... well, no one important ever disappears, so it doesn't really matter, does it.”",3.0,2.9
"I could tell she was trying to remember whom she had known who had left, and failing.",2.6,3.0
No one contradicted her.,2.9,2.9
No one offered a different answer.,3.0,2.9
I looked at Adrienne.,3.0,2.88
Mission accomplished: Our routine insouciance had been disrupted.,3.43,3.43
The scales had tipped.,2.86,3.0
(I reserved the right to revise this opinion later.),3.0,2.7
"From the looks on my companions' faces, I knew they were thinking the same.",3.0,3.1
“How long have you been here?”,2.9,2.7
"The question, previously posed to me, was presented to the rest of our group (excluding Ray; Adrienne had been tactful enough to wait until he had gone for a refill, recalling the last time the subject was broached).",2.75,3.12
"Sarah, she tilted her head and tapped a finger on the side of her wine glass.",3.12,2.88
A long time.,3.0,3.0
"Got to be months and months, at least.",3.0,2.44
"“You were here before I was,”",3.0,2.9
"“You were here before I was,” said Kishori, “and so was Tiffany.”",3.1,3.1
"When I was done mentally exclaiming over my impossible rescue, I looked around.",2.7,3.5
“and so was Tiffany.”,2.9,2.8
I looked at Zheng; he shrugged.,2.9,2.8
“Time passes in a weird way here.,3.0,2.6
“Time passes in a weird way here. I kept track for a while—thirty-eight days—but after that... I guess I didn't see the point.”,2.8,3.0
I kept track for a while—thirty-eight days—but after that...,2.9,3.0
I guess I didn't see the point.”,2.6,2.9
Fact: Some places are timeless.,3.1,3.3
“Why not?”,3.0,3.0
asked Adrienne.,3.0,2.9
"“Days don't matter,”",3.0,2.9
"“Days don't matter,” he said.",2.4,2.9
"Tiffany nodded, but Kishori spoke before the other woman could.",2.89,3.0
“Why are you so interested?”,3.11,3.0
she asked Adrienne.,3.0,2.7
Adrienne met her gaze.,3.12,2.87
“I don't want to be here forever.”,2.25,3.62
"“But we're not here forever,”",3.0,3.0
"“But we're not here forever,” objected Sarah.",2.87,3.0
“Remember?,3.1,3.0
“Remember? Alexis left.”,2.9,3.1
Alexis left.”,2.9,2.9
"“Disappeared,”",2.9,3.0
"“Disappeared,” I corrected her.",2.9,2.9
“We don't know how or why he left.,2.3,2.9
“We don't know how or why he left. Or where he went.”,2.7,3.0
Or where he went.”,3.0,2.78
Zheng looked thoughtful.,3.14,2.86
"The ship, it was odd and old, either so outdated or so heavily modified that I couldn't tell what make it was, and somehow, the crew standing around me fit the same description, a singularly atypical amalgamation of folk.",2.78,2.89
"He picked up his glass, swirled the liquid around, took a sip, then set the glass back down.",3.0,2.9
He glanced around at the rest of us.,2.9,3.3
“Do you want to leave?”,3.0,3.2
he asked.,3.0,2.4
“Could you live anywhere else now?”,2.8,3.2
I spoke up.,3.22,3.22
"“Yes,”",3.3,3.0
"“Yes,” I said.",3.29,3.14
"“I wouldn't miss this, much.”",2.8,3.3
No one else said anything.,2.82,2.55
I watched Adrienne's eyes move from one face to the next.,2.8,3.2
"Zheng, he addressed me again, leaning forward with his elbows on his knees and an intense, steady gaze.",2.9,3.1
"“You think that,”",3.0,3.0
"“You think that,” he said, “but is it true?",3.0,3.0
"“but is it true? Would you be happy back in a normal life, working and living and crying in the drudgery of whatever the hell normal is these days?”",2.67,3.11
Fact: It's too easy to fall into patterns.,2.86,2.86
Fact: I wasn't sure I wanted the dream stage to end.,3.0,2.78
My quarters felt stifling.,2.22,3.11
Asphyxiating my mind.,2.6,3.2
"I sat sideways in the armchair, feet dangling over one arm, neck resting against the other, absently tracing invisible lines between the stars outside my window as I ruminated on the situation.",2.9,3.1
The lightscreen had proved singularly unhelpful.,2.4,3.0
"I inspected the arrays of entertainment options—abstract, old-style flatscreens, engrossing VR flicks and action games, a selection of quondam bestsellers and a few recently released novels hoping to gain popularity.",3.1,2.7
"There was a schedule advertising upcoming on-ship events, such as dance classes, craft sessions, and discussion groups, and a list of dinner invitations for me to respond to.",3.1,2.9
"A menu of display options, allowing me to customize all the lightscreen's superficial characteristics.",2.9,2.5
A simple contact system for communicating with other people on the ship.,2.9,2.5
That was all.,3.0,2.9
"A methodical search of my two adjoining rooms, the ample closet space, and the attached bathroom facility had similarly provided no fodder.",2.7,2.8
"Furniture (dark wood, expensive, polished, no secret compartments), clothes, leftover tray of half-consumed food from the previous day's lunch, toiletries (complete with miniature bottles of sweet-smelling apricot honey lotion), lightscreen, me.",3.0,3.0
I was discouraged and frustrated.,2.2,3.6
I wanted to prove to Adrienne that I wanted solve the ship's mystery just as much as she did.,3.12,3.5
"I wanted to find something, anything, that would prove all this was normal and sane.",2.86,3.14
"And me, I guess I was one more piece in their puzzle.",2.8,3.0
I didn't want to think about disappearances and time and purposes and consequences.,2.67,2.67
I wanted my contentment back.,2.8,3.1
I cornered Adrienne at dinner that night.,2.9,3.1
"In one hand I balanced my plate of star-shaped crackers, globs of elegant dips and garnishes, little rolled balls of meats and cheeses stabbed through with spears of some pale green plant, and an array of other delectable, bite-sized items.",3.4,3.1
My other hand pointedly steered Adrienne to a small table against a wall.,3.1,3.1
"She glared at me, but obediently let me pull her along.",3.0,3.18
"“Tell me,”",2.8,3.1
"“Tell me,” I said, after we sat, “what you have found.”",3.0,3.4
"I was one more scrap to weld onto the rest, one more stranded survivor who was found.",2.63,3.12
“what you have found.”,3.0,3.1
It wasn't a question.,2.7,3.0
"She gave me a grumpy look that informed me, quite clearly, of her current opinion of me.",2.25,3.25
“Not if you're going to be rude about it.”,1.9,3.6
I sighed.,2.2,2.7
“Sorry.”,2.3,3.1
"I wasn't, not really, but I'd lie to get the conversation going.",3.12,3.0
“I want to know.”,3.0,3.1
"I explained, in two brief sentences, my earlier impasse.",3.0,2.9
"“I don't know much,”",2.6,2.8
"“I don't know much,” she said, still annoyed but at least cooperative.",2.44,3.11
"She reviewed the information gleaned from our previous dinner conversations, adding, “I heard the captain say something yesterday, as I walking to the Pyrope Parlor.",3.0,2.8
"“I heard the captain say something yesterday, as I walking to the Pyrope Parlor. I was just coming up on a corner and he was around the other side, talking to a couple people, and they must not have known I was there. He said something about a wreck going well. And listen, when they came round the corner, Ray was with the captain.”",2.9,3.1
"I was just coming up on a corner and he was around the other side, talking to a couple people, and they must not have known I was there.",2.8,3.0
He said something about a wreck going well.,3.0,3.1
"And listen, when they came round the corner, Ray was with the captain.”",3.1,3.0
"The next time the captain stopped by our group, Tiffany tagging along (pretending that she, too, was a social butterfly who could mingle equally well with everyone), we were ready.",3.0,3.1
I was now one of them.,3.12,3.12
“Is there a doctor on board?”,2.8,3.5
asked Adrienne.,3.0,2.67
“I've been having headaches.”,2.27,3.27
"This story, it's our story.",3.0,3.1
"It was a lie, but we needed information.",2.7,2.9
Jefferson nodded.,3.0,2.8
"“Down past the Emerald Lounge, second door on the left.",3.0,2.71
"“Down past the Emerald Lounge, second door on the left. All hours.”",3.12,3.12
All hours.”,2.89,2.89
"A robot, then.",3.0,3.0
Medical AI were even more expensive than the barkeep.,2.5,2.88
I wondered how many people it treated.,3.12,3.12
Had anyone on the ship ever fallen seriously ill?,2.9,2.9
"The survivors of the unfortunate accidents, the catastrophic malfunctions, the fateful crashes: this is us.",2.33,2.89
“Does he age?”,3.0,3.0
asked Adrienne.,3.0,2.89
“The captain?”,3.0,3.2
I shrugged.,2.5,3.2
“I never thought about it.”,3.0,2.09
Adrienne steepled her fingers and studied my face.,3.0,2.83
"“That doesn't answer my question,”",2.38,3.5
"“That doesn't answer my question,” she said.",2.4,3.0
Adrienne only picked at her food.,2.56,2.89
“Not hungry?”,3.0,2.89
asked Kishori sympathetically.,3.0,3.0
"“No,”",2.2,3.0
"“No,” said Adrienne.",2.25,3.5
"“At least have a drink,”",3.1,2.8
"“At least have a drink,” said Sarah.",3.0,3.1
“I find it takes the edge off.”,3.1,2.7

said Kishori.,3.0,2.8
"“Maybe that's the problem,”",2.6,3.4
"“Maybe that's the problem,” said Sarah.",2.75,2.88
"“One hundred and forty-seven is a magic number,”",3.2,3.3
"“One hundred and forty-seven is a magic number,” said Sarah.",3.1,3.0
“You ever heard of Dunbar?,2.91,2.73
"“You ever heard of Dunbar? Well, we've got the perfect-size group right here.”",3.5,3.3
"Well, we've got the perfect-size group right here.”",3.38,3.0
Just enough for us all to be able to barely avoid killing each other.,2.6,3.0
“Why doesn't anyone mutiny?”,2.8,3.1
Adrienne asked.,3.09,2.82
"“If you dislike this place so much, why don't you do something about it?”",2.38,3.25
"“We can't,”",2.3,3.1
“What would we do?”,3.0,2.75
Adrienne shook her head and made a sound of disgust.,1.62,3.5
“You could force the captain to set down somewhere.,2.75,3.37
"“You could force the captain to set down somewhere. Let us off the ship. If he refuses, threaten him. If he still refuses, well, of all of us, isn't there someone who can drive a ship?”",2.3,3.6
Let us off the ship.,2.9,3.2
"If he refuses, threaten him.",2.44,3.33
"If he still refuses, well, of all of us, isn't there someone who can drive a ship?”",2.9,3.1
"Floating alone, each of us facing the silence of the vacuum, we were found.",3.0,3.0
"“That's murder,”",2.1,3.6
"“That's murder,” objected Sarah.",2.3,3.5
"“That's survival, ”",3.0,2.5
"“That's survival, ” Adrienne corrected her.",2.88,3.5
“Do you want to be stuck here for the rest of your life?”,2.1,3.6
"I shifted my feet in the plush green carpeting of the Emerald Lounge, looking out the windows at the stars.",3.5,2.8
"Times like that, running on less sleep than I should, alone because everyone else had had the sense to retire for the night, I had a tendency to get all meditative about the universe and my place in it.",3.0,2.56
"The stillness of the room contributed, as did the view.",3.0,2.89
"Black and more black, speckled by tiny points of light that flared up to break the emptiness, if only for a brief time.",3.0,2.57
"All of it was temporary, save for the black.",2.8,2.7
That was tonight's melodramatic theme: the ephemeral nature of life.,3.0,2.6
"Once found, we can never be lost.",3.4,3.0
Everything temporary.,3.0,2.8
"Everything to fade away, lost as dust and scattered atoms between the stars, and every one of us to be left as alone as the moment we were born.",2.6,3.1
"Eyes bulging in panic, but no screams.",2.5,3.5
"Some things in this world, we have to make them permanent ourselves.",2.91,3.09
This is our Hotel California.,3.0,2.8
He had made us a constant.,3.0,2.75
He made this ship—this life—a constant.,3.11,3.11
The one thing that was known.,3.0,2.63
The one thing that wouldn't change.,2.9,2.8
"Maybe everything we did, all the stories we told, maybe it was all lies.",2.5,3.2
We can never leave.,2.38,3.0
"But ultimately, this ship, its purpose, our purpose—did it matter?",2.91,2.82
We each had our own theory.,3.13,3.0
Maybe that was enough.,2.9,3.2
"And all of us, we were permanent characters in each others' stories.",3.14,3.0
"“So, I'm on a ship now?",3.0,3.33
"“So, I'm on a ship now? You do this a lot?”",3.0,3.0
Maybe that made us more real.,3.2,2.8
Maybe it made us feel less alone.,2.89,2.78
